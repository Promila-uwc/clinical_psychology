This chapter sets forth our theme of integrating clinical science and clinical
practice. We discuss the philosophical and practical or applied aspects of
clinical psychology and place clinical psychology in perspective relative to the
historical, social, gender, cultural, and scientific environments in which it was
created and in which it and we, as clinical psychologists, exist.
Our model is based on clinical psychology as a general treatment model,
with the clinical psychologist serving as a primary care practitioner: the “psychological family doctor.” This chapter also delineates the direction and plan for
the book.
Learning Objectives
At the end of this chapter, the reader should be able to:
• List five historical markers in the conceptualization and treatment of
clinical phenomena.
• Identify three scientific eras that have influenced the development of
clinical psychology.
• Describe the contemporary organizational environment of the field of
clinical psychology.
• Explain the concept of the clinical psychologist as a primary care
practitioner.
• List at least 10 learning objectives for reading the chapters ahead.
Mary, a doctoral-level psychologist, was at a party where the hostess introduced her to someone by saying, “This is Mary. She’s a psychologist.” The
4 Introduction
other person smiled and said, “Whoops. I better be careful what I say so you
won’t be analyzing me.” Mary’s response was that she was not a clinical psychologist, but an experimental psychologist working on aspects of language acquisition in chimpanzees.
It is of more than passing interest to know that many people who hear the
word psychologist assume that the person so identified is a clinical psychologist.
Many people use variations of the term psychology to denote motivation (“I am
really psyched for that date”), readiness (“I am psyched for that exam”), intimidation (“I really psyched him out”), or a person who appears to be out of touch
with reality or with societal norms (“That guy is really psycho”). The range of
psychology applications and practice is discussed in Chapter 2. In this introductory chapter, we discuss the history and development of clinical psychology as
a practice, a science, and a treatment; and we place clinical psychology in perspective relative to the historical, social, gender, cultural, and scientific environments from which it emerged.
Writing a text such as this one takes a great deal of thought and discussion
among the authors. We have had to decide what to include, what to exclude,
and how to present the material in as scientific, readable, and useful way as
possible. We have, between us, over a century of experience, first as students
and then as university faculty members and practitioners. We are aware of the
challenges in developing a text. Will it hold your interest? Will it allow your instructor to elaborate on the ideas we present? Will it provide the requisite information? The latter two points are in fact relatively easy to fulfill. To keep
you interested is a much harder job. For this reason, we have decided to talk to
you directly and to think of you as one of our students.
The clinical psychologist, in the simplest definition, works in a clinical setting, with clinical populations, and uses clinical interventions. But what does that
mean? Clinics are usually for people needing treatment of one sort or another. A
look at a hospital directory might list the hours of operation for the spine clinic,
the asthma clinic, the well-baby clinic, or the mood clinic. That is where you
would expect to find clinical psychologists. Although this has been true for much
of the existence of clinical psychology, the appellation of clinical has now been affixed to other terms such as clinical health psychology, clinical child psychology,
or clinical neuropsychology.
The notion that people have emotional problems is not new. That some
people act unacceptably within their social or family group and are thought to
be deviant from their fellows is, instead, an ancient belief. Rather than dazing
(or amazing) you with the historical or prehistorical experience of psychology,
we have decided to make it easy.
We are going to take you for a ride on an incredible magic carpet. Not
only can it fly though the air, it allows you to board without going through a
metal detector. Second, it can travel through time so that we can view many
experiences, circumstances, and situations. Third, it renders us invisible so that
we can observe others and not be seen. Fourth, it is soundproof so that we can
discuss what we are seeing without being heard. Fifth, if, for any reason, our
trip is interrupted, you can climb aboard again and take up where you left off.
Sixth, this magic carpet has a universal translator that allows us to listen in to
what is going on in front of us. Finally, it will safely return us to our starting
The History, Politics, and Social Environment of Clinical Psychology 5
point. Please note that no snacks will be served on this flight so before embarking, collect your favorite snacks to take along.
A Flying Carpet Tour of Clinical Psychology
If you are safely aboard, our first stop is prehistory. We can feel the heat. We
are on a plain in Africa. A formerly social and well-adjusted member of the
tribe has been howling at the moon, attacking other members of the tribe, and
having uncontrolled seizures or other acts against the best interest of the tribe,
clan, or group. He has been caught and subdued by other members of the tribe
and has been rendered unconscious by being forced to drink a potion the tribal
healer has concocted from herbs and flowers. The healer is about to perform a
surgical procedure still used today, called trephining. She is using sharpened
flints to bore a hole in the person’s skull to release the demons and spirits that
have been trapped there. Releasing the demons should relieve the patient of
their “possession.”
Although we might expect the patient to die from what we see as a barbaric operation, skulls dating back thousands of years have been found with
holes drilled in the skull, and the regrowth of bone indicates that the person
survived. Scientists think that the holes were drilled to release demons that inhabited the individual causing aberrant behavior. In other cases, the clan healer
might simply offer potions made from roots, barks, or leaves of plants as prescriptions for various disorders. Some combinations of drugs calmed the angry
patient, and others likely energized the inactive individual. What we now call
“folk” remedies were the earliest attempts at dealing with the broad range of illnesses, including those that we now label as psychological disorders. If we listen
carefully, we might hear the healer give the man’s wife a bag of herbs and
leaves, and instruct her to brew a tea with them when the man awakens from
his surgery.
If you will hold on tight, we are going to move on to ancient Greece. Before we fly into the office of a healer, there are some things that you need to
know. The Greeks posited that there were four basic elements; fire, water,
earth, and air. As all persons were constructed of these elements, their balance
within the body was of major importance. Each element would correspond
with a particular characteristic that would create a humor within the body: fire
= blood humor; earth = black bile humor; water = yellow bile humor, and air =
phlegm humor. Fire, of course, was hot. Water was wet. Earth was dry, and air
was cold. The particular humoral mix could be seen in the person’s personality
and behavioral style. These ideas seem quaint to us today, but we still refer back
to them. An angry person is said to be “hot-blooded” or to have a “fiery temper.” The old term for depression, melancholy, stems from the terms melan
(black, as in melanin) and choli (bile, as in colon). Melan + Coli = melancholy.
We may describe someone as phlegmatic, meaning “subdued.”
In the quarters of the ancient Greek healer, we have an opportunity to
watch a treatment. The healer is assessing the patient’s humoral mix and will
then prescribe a treatment. The patient reports that he is often angry, and the
6 Introduction
anger involves him in physical fights with family, friends, and even strangers.
The healer is recommending bloodletting as the treatment of choice to lower the
force of the blood humor that is obviously creating the problem. The patient lies
on a couch and the healer cuts into the patient’s arm and blood flows copiously
into a bowl held by the healer’s assistant. When the healer has seen enough
blood flow, she will stanch the bleeding with folded linen and pressure. The patient will then rest. Other treatments might include enemas to relieve the excess of black bile, forced purging or the use of emetics for yellow bile, or
compression of the chest for too much air.
If you found that scene a bit unpleasant, be forewarned that the next stop
may be even more visceral. We are now in medieval France. We are flying over a
walled town, and in the middle of the town square workers are preparing for an
execution. They are piling branches and wood around a stone column. Set high
in the column is an iron ring. We are all thinking the same thing. They are planning on burning someone to death. There, off to the right we can see a woman
being dragged toward the post. We can hear the charges against her being read.
Fortunately our carpet allows us to understand medieval French. The
prisoner was found guilty of practicing the black arts, witchcraft. The court, a
church court it seems, has sentenced her and two other women to be burned as
witches. Her hands are tied to the iron ring and her feet secured. She is gagged
so she cannot say anything or cast a spell. A torch is lit. I think it is time for us
to leave this place.
In the Middle Ages, the church developed as an arbiter of both what is
normal and what is abnormal, and then offered “cures” for the abnormal behavior. These cures ranged from prayer and meditation to exorcism and execution.
The inquisition brought with it the beating, flogging, burning, hanging, and
drowning of those suspected of trafficking in the black arts. Interestingly, those
black arts included healing and midwifery. If a town was unfortunate enough
to have a disease manifestation such as the plague, it was considered the work
of witches. Only a concerted search for the witches and their immediate eradication could cleanse and heal the community.
Our next stop is going to be the seventeenth-century town of Salem,
Massachusetts. We think that you know what we will find. We are in a courtroom. As you can see, everyone is dressed just like the Pilgrims in the pictures
of the first Thanksgiving. This, however, is no celebration. A woman is
dragged into the courtroom and brought before the two judges. The charges
against her involve witchcraft. The accusers are three teenage girls who report having seen the woman muttering “spells” and having a conversation
with her cat. Some of the woman’s neighbors testify that they, too, saw her
“acting strangely,” though other townspeople testify that she is a harmless
person who caused no problems for anyone.
At that moment, we see something incredible. The teenage accusers fall to
the floor of the courtroom and seem to be having spasms and convulsions. They
point to the woman as they are doing it. Amazingly, the girls’ behavior is entered as “evidence” against the woman and she is pronounced a witch and sentenced to burn. We would later learn of the death of several women based on
the report of these teenage girls. Interestingly, when it was decided to stop
using the girls’ behavior as evidence, the girls’ spasms ceased.
The History, Politics, and Social Environment of Clinical Psychology 7
Our next stop on this magic carpet is outside Paris on a sunny Sunday afternoon. The year is about 1785. It is before the French Revolution, and the
wealthy and elite of Paris are obvious. We can see carriages arriving, and welldressed men and women are emerging from the carriages. It seems that their
destination is a mental hospital called Salpetriére. The visitors do not seem intent
on seeing a relative who might be residing in this particular hospital, but rather
they are strolling along and viewing the inmates as if visiting a zoo. We can see
some inmates posed in postures that they seem to hold for exceedingly long periods. Other inmates are playing with pieces of wood. A woman is cradling a rag
as if it were a baby. The onlookers delicately cover their noses with perfumed
handkerchiefs to block the odor coming from feces-encrusted inmates, rotting
food, and inadequate hygiene facilities. Servants are setting a picnic lunch for
some of the sightseers . . . far away from the hospital building.
A quick trip over the English Channel takes us to an English hospital for
lunatics: St. Mary Bethlehem, also known as the Bethlem Royal Hospital.
Coming from within the walls of this building we hear the rumble of human
voices. Some are shouting, some are crying, and some are making noises that
we cannot interpret. When we hear the cacophony, we think that this place
sounds as if it is out of control. It seems to exist without any sense of order.
There is confusion and uproar everywhere. It is, in fact, pure bedlam—a contraction of the hospital’s name still used to denote what we are witnessing.
Bedlam is the uncontrolled and confusing events and actions we see in the
midst of crises. We see visitors touring the hospital who, like their Parisian
counterparts, are laughing and mocking the residents. Some are even carrying
long poles to prod the patients and make them angry within their cages so that
they will react with outrage and produce a better “show.” The guardians of
these patients do nothing to protect their charges.
We fly back to eighteenth-century Paris and stop at the salon of a physician, Dr. Franz Anton Mesmer. He was born in 1734 and died in 1815. He was
credited by some as having accidentally discovered the idea of group therapy.
Mesmer argued that health or illness was a result of the harmony or discord between the bodily fluids and the planets (e.g., “lunacy” was a result of the gravitational pull of the moon). He later redefined his theory and suggested that
harmony or discord within the individual was a result of some distortion of the
internal magnetic fields.
Let’s observe Mesmer at work. Several patients are sitting around an oak
tub, and the “magnetic fluid” is sending magnetic forces through iron bars
that patients are holding as extensions from the tub. Mesmer is walking
around and speaking soothingly and quietly to the patients. He lays his hands
on them and evaluates the balance of their magnetic fluid. Some of the patients in his treatments appear to faint or swoon and others seem to sit transfixed during their treatment. We would later learn that in the spirit of the
time, scientific support was deemed to be the mark of any treatment. After an
investigation by the Paris Academy of Sciences, Mesmer’s model of treatment
was found to be without merit and the academy would not support it. Although Mesmer later died in obscurity, his name lingers far beyond his treatment to describe someone who is mesmerized as being fixed on an object or in
a trancelike state.
8 Introduction
We now fly ahead to Vienna in the early twentieth century, where a
young neurologist has been building quite a reputation for himself. Dr. Sigmund Freud, frustrated at not getting the faculty appointment that he so
badly wanted in the Department of Neurology at the University of Vienna, is
about to give a lecture. He has abandoned his academic quest and has started
a practice to treat patients who have what he calls “nervous disorders.” Freud
has not yet come to the podium and we can hear comments and discussion by
members of the audience. “I’m aghast at some of the things that I heard about
him,” commented a lawyer. “Well, he writes rather nicely, but some of his
statements are a bit, how shall I say this? Over the edge,” responded an
accountant sitting nearby. A businessman commented, “His work is unsavory,
at the least.” A fourth commented, “Well, he is one of us, so we should listen
respectfully.”
Freud comes to the stage and is introduced as the speaker of the evening.
The president of the Vienna lodge of B’nai B’rith, a group of Jewish professionals, presents Freud and his topic: The Interpretation of Dreams. We can only wonder what Freud has done or said to make it so difficult for him to get a hearing
on this subject from his medical colleagues. He has sought to go to the people
for this presentation. The group listens to his presentation, but by the shakes of
their heads, and the shared smiles, they are finding his presentation of dreams
as the “royal road to the unconscious” a bit much.
Let’s get back on our carpet and take a quick trip forward. World War I
has broken out, and we are in an army recruitment center in 1917. Recruits are
being given a test to determine their abilities and aptitude. The results of the
tests will help in placing the soldiers where the military can gain the greatest
value from their contributions. Two officers are discussing the testing program.
“Darn shame this test. What they need to do is fight. Just courage and a gun is
what they need. They’ll do what we tell them to do just like before, and heaven
help them that doesn’t do what we tell them.” The second officer responds that
he had experiences in Cuba some 20 years earlier with soldiers who appeared
to understand instructions, but were later killed. “We need to build a core of
competent, intelligent soldiers and more intelligent officers. Maybe this way of
selecting them will make a difference.”
The second officer does not know how prophetic he is. Binet’s work will
be the basis for the Army Alpha and the Army Beta tests in years to come. The
Army Alpha and Beta tests were standardized measures for screening large
numbers of people to optimize recruit placement. These tests identified aptitudes and skills to determine which positions in the military would be suitable
for an able recruit. Each test served the same purpose, but the Beta test could
be administered to individuals who did not speak English as a primary language. The fact that all individuals could be examined with these assessments
became significant not only for military recruiting purposes at the time but also
for clinical applications after the war.
Hold on. We leave again and head for England. It is 1938 and we are observing an old man speaking into an early wire recording machine. He speaks
slowly and deliberately because of the prosthesis in his mouth. His speech is
somewhat muffled but we can make out his English. It is Sigmund Freud
speaking of his career:
The History, Politics, and Social Environment of Clinical Psychology 9
I started my professional activities as a neurologist trying to bring relief to my neurotic patients. Under the influence of an older friend [Josef Breuer] and by my own
efforts I discovered some important new facts about the unconscious, insight, the
role of instinctual urges, and so on. Using these new findings, I developed a new
science, psychoanalysis, a branch of psychology as a new method for the treatment
of the neurosis. I had to pay heavily for this bit of good luck. People did not believe
in my facts and thought my theories unsavory. In the end I succeeded in acquiring
pupils and bringing up an international psychoanalytic association. But the struggle is not yet over.
He stops for a moment and then says, “Sigmund Freud.” We know that
he died of cancer the following year. It must make us thoughtful that by his
own words, Freud saw psychoanalysis as part of what we would call clinical
psychology.
Next we travel to the United States. It is 1944, and we are looking in on a
military strategy meeting at the Pentagon in Washington, DC. The Army is pondering what to do about World War II soldiers suffering from combat fatigue.
(In World War I, it was called shellshock.) “We need to be able to do something
with these boys,” declares a colonel. Wearing the insignia of the medical corps,
he argues for more psychiatrists for both field hospital work and behind the
lines. The brigadier general asserts, “If they are doctors, we need them to be
cutting and patching these kids up to save their lives. I am less worried about
their mental health if they have shrapnel in their gut.” A major tentatively
raises his hand. “What about the possibility of using psychologists to deal with
the psychological problems? They are not physicians but they have studied
about helping people with psychological problems.” “Where would we find
them?” asked the colonel. “I can contact several universities and see who might
be available,” replied the major. “Do it,” commands the general.
Our next stop is at a coffeehouse in Witwatersrand, South Africa. It is the
early 1950s. A young psychiatrist is discussing an idea with another colleague.
“It seems obvious. If patients are anxious, they have great difficulty being relaxed. If they are relaxed it is hard to be anxious. What if we can teach anxious
patients to relax? Wouldn’t that ease their problem?” His colleague shook his
head. “Dr. Wolpe, don’t be foolish! You are a trained psychoanalyst. You know
that the anxiety is a symptom of the underlying conflicts. Sure, we can remove
the anxiety for a moment or two, but it will return. Even if we help to remove
the anxiety about one situation, it will only return in another symptom. Besides, the complexity of the anxiety disorders cannot be explained in so simple a
paradigm.” We can only smile knowing the enormous impact that Joseph Wolpe
had on his generations of students and thereby on millions of anxious patients.
Back to the Future
At this point, we come back and land our magic carpet. The rest of the history of
clinical psychology belongs in today’s world. The associations, organizations, divisions, meetings, certifying bodies, and philosophies of practice are contemporary.
10 Introduction
Yet in the practices, publications, and missions of these institutions, we see the
historical influence of the people, events, and scientific eras that have shaped the
field of clinical psychology.
Major Organizations Concerned with Scientific Practice
Major organizational bodies relevant to the professional culture of clinical psychology include the American Board of Professional Psychology (ABPP), the
American Psychological Association (APA), and the Association for Behavioral
and Cognitive Therapies (ABCT). Each of these organizations has specialty subdivisions that reflect the growing complexity of clinical psychology. Established
in 1948, the American Board of Examiners in Professional Psychology (now
shortened to American Board of Professional Psychology), offers advanced certification of competency in a subspecialty of clinical psychology. These specialties include clinical psychology, clinical child and adolescent psychology, and
clinical neuropsychology.
Founded in 1892, the American Psychological Association (APA) is the
largest worldwide association of psychologists. With approximately 150,000
members, the APA offers a vast number of programs and initiatives, including
56 numbered divisions or special interest groups that focus on particular topics. Clinical psychologists are often affiliated with the following APA divisions:
Clinical Psychology (12), Psychotherapy (29), Psychoanalysis (39), Psychologists in Independent Practice (42), and Society of Clinical Child and Adolescent
Psychology (53). There are many other divisions that the clinical psychologist
might be interested in joining. For additional information, see www.apa.org.
APA Division 12—Clinical Psychology
APA members who belong to this division are active in practice, research,
teaching, administration, and study in the field of clinical psychology. Graduate
students in APA approved or regionally accredited doctoral programs may become student affiliates. Members and student affiliates may also join one or
more sections of the division: Section II: Clinical Geropsychology; Section III:
The Society for a Science of Clinical Psychology; Section IV: Clinical Psychology
of Women; Section VI: Clinical Psychology of Ethnic Minorities; Section VII:
Emergencies and Crises; Section VIII: Association of Psychologists in Academic
Health Centers (APAHC); Section IX: Assessment; and Section X: Graduate Students and Early Career Psychologists.
APA Division 29—Psychotherapy
APA members who also belong to this division share in fostering collegial relations among APA members who are interested in psychotherapy. This division
stimulates the exchange of information about psychotherapy, encourages the
evaluation and development of the practice of psychotherapy, educates the
public about the service of psychotherapists, and promotes the general objectives of the APA.
The History, Politics, and Social Environment of Clinical Psychology 11
APA Division 39—Psychoanalysis
This division encompasses the diversity and richness of psychoanalytic theory,
research, and clinical practice. The nine sections within Division 39 represent
members’ broad interests: (I) Psychologists-Psychoanalyst Practitioners; (II)
Childhood and Adolescence; (III) Women, Gender, and Psychoanalysis; (IV)
Local Chapters; (V) Psychologist-Psychoanalysts’ Clinicians; (VI) Psychoanalytic Research Society; (VII) Psychoanalysis and Groups; (VIII) Section on Family Therapy; and (IX) Psychoanalysis of Social Responsibility.
APA Division 42—Psychologists in Independent Practice
This APA membership division deals with psychological services in all independent practice settings and advocates on behalf of consumers of these services.
Through its committees and task forces, it promotes quality and accessibility.
The division also provides a forum for issues affecting independent practice at
the APA convention and at the annual Practice Development Conference.
APA Division 53—Society of Clinical Child and
Adolescent Psychology
This group of APA represents psychologists who are active in teaching, research, clinical services, administration, and advocacy in clinical child psychology. The division has established research and professional service
awards, including an annual student research award and also sponsors publications describing graduate programs and clinical internships that provide
specialized training in clinical child psychology. The division also supports
task forces on the development and evaluation of evidence-based treatments
for childhood disorders and coordinates efforts for dissemination of information about evidence-based services.
Association for Behavioral and Cognitive Therapies
The Association for Behavioral and Cognitive Therapies (ABCT; formerly the
Association for Advancement of Behavior Therapy) was founded in 1966. The
founders were among the elite of behavior therapy, but many mainstream psychologists considered the ABCT to be a radical splinter group.
Although ABCT draws members from various mental health disciplines
(psychiatry, social work, psychiatric nursing, counseling), the bulk of the approximately 5,000 member organization comprises clinical psychologists who
share a fundamental interest in integrating science and practice. Their mission
is to relieve human suffering by designing, testing, developing, and disseminating culturally sensitive methods that work, based on the latest scientific advancements (www.abct.org). Advancement of empirically based practice was
the original momentum for the founding of this organization. Over time, scientific developments have led this group toward focusing on cognitive innovations and discoveries, and the name of the organization was officially changed
in 2004. Because cognitive-behavior therapy is based on broad principles of
human learning and adaptation, it can accomplish a wide variety of goals. The
12 Introduction
therapy has been applied to issues ranging from depression and anxiety to the
improvement of parenting, relationships, and personal effectiveness.
Training Philosophy in Clinical Psychology
In 1949, at the request of the newly formed Committee on Accreditation of
APA, the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) sponsored a conference
in Boulder, Colorado, to discuss the development of standards for training in
clinical psychology. This conference was, in effect, a step in the government’s
initiative to tap the resources of psychology for the WWII effort, circa 1944
Washington, DC. Although some clinical psychology training programs were
in existence at the time, the content, length, format, requirements, and missions varied. All the programs were housed in university departments, but
some were in graduate schools of arts and science and others were in schools
of education.
The government connection was a boon to the development of clinical
psychology. The Veterans Administration (VA) and the NIMH offered training
funds for internship sites. The ideas and protocols developed at the Boulder
conference became known as the “Boulder Model” for clinical training.
The participants at the conference agreed that the minimal training must include a PhD, thereby placing psychologists squarely in the midst of their academic colleagues in other disciplines. Psychologists were to be scientists and
therefore would be trained to be competent in research as well as the development of clinical skills and competencies. This dual emphasis resulted in the
notion of the clinical psychologist being educated and trained as a scientistpractitioner.
The Boulder conference established the following parameters for doctoral
training in clinical psychology:
• Boulder-model programs in clinical psychology award the PhD degree.
• The appropriate location for clinical psychology training is a university department, usually in a faculty of arts and science, not in a separate school
that is part of a university (e.g., law, medicine, dentistry) or in a freestanding school (e.g., many schools of medicine).
• The program can be one of several programs within an academic
department.
• Clinical psychologists are to be prepared for work in both the academic
world and the practice world.
• The APA Committee on Accreditation provides an approval and accreditation for training programs in clinical psychology. The accreditation process, though meticulous and sometimes arduous to complete, has made
the designation “APA accredited” the gold standard for clinical psychology
programs.
• The PhD programs require a research-based dissertation as a requirement
for the completion of the degree.
The History, Politics, and Social Environment of Clinical Psychology 13
• To provide maximum funding through grants, fellowships, and scholarships, small numbers of carefully selected students are admitted.
• Limiting the number of students facilitates maximum mentorship of
students, as the goal is successful training of every student accepted for
admission.
The scientist-practitioner model was questioned by many practicing clinicians. As early as the 1960s, the scientist-practitioner emphasis was under
scrutiny. As an alternative approach to training, the California School of Professional Psychology was founded by Dr. Nicholas Cummings in 1969. Cummings, a former president of APA and a behavioral science entrepreneur,
worked with the California State Psychological Association to develop a PhD
program that more strongly emphasized the applied clinical aspect of clinical
psychology. Cummings, who is president of the Foundation for Behavioral
Health and Chairman of the Nicholas & Dorothy Cummings Foundation, Inc.,
was the founding CEO of American Biodyne (MedCo/Merck, then Merit, now
Magellan Behavioral Care), the first U.S. behavioral managed care company.
Dr. Cummings has also founded four campuses of the California School of
Professional Psychology, the National Academies of Practice, the American
Managed Behavioral Healthcare Association, and the National Council of Professional Schools of Psychology. Cummings has advanced the view that clinical psychologists should be trained to be knowledgeable consumers and
contributors to research, but that this is secondary to skill development for
clinical interventions.
The issues raised by Cummings and others led to a second major conference on training philosophy held in 1973 in Vail, Colorado, and the proceedings
of this conference became known as the “Vail Model.” The Vail conferees endorsed different principles from those endorsed by the conferees at the earlier
Boulder conference, leading to an alternative training model (D. R. Peterson,
1976, 1982). Psychological knowledge, it was argued, had matured enough to
warrant creation of explicitly professional programs along the lines of professional programs in medicine, dentistry, and law. These professional programs
were to be added to, not replace, Boulder-model doctoral programs. Further, it
was proposed that different degrees should designate the scientist-practitioner
role (PhD; emphasis on the term scientist) from the practitioner-scholar role
(PsyD—Doctor of Psychology; with emphasis on the term practitioner).
The Vail conference asserted the following parameters for doctoral training in clinical psychology:
• Vail-model programs in clinical psychology award a Doctorate of Psychology degree, referred to as a PsyD.
• Vail-model programs can be housed in three types of organizational settings. They are found in a psychology department that is part of a university setting. They are also found in a university-affiliated professional or
psychology school that may be part of a university. Or, they exist as independent, freestanding schools of professional psychology. The latter programs are not affiliated with universities; but rather are independently
developed and staffed.
14 Introduction
• These professional training programs focus primarily on clinical practice and
less on research, but graduates should know how to do research and how to
appropriately access and use research to inform their clinical practice.
• Professional schools can be not-for-profit or for-profit institutions and
several schools of professional psychology are affiliated in a network of
freestanding professional schools. These schools offer doctoral programs
in clinical psychology, and graduate work in counseling and master’s level
programs.
• PsyD programs are responsive to the market demands for clinical services
in their enrollment policies and procedures. Compared with PhD programs, they will enroll as many as three times the number of incoming
doctoral candidates per school (Mayne, Norcross, & Sayette, 1994). Over
time, this will create greater numerical parity in psychologist graduates
from scientist-practitioner programs.
The differences between clinical PhD and clinical PsyD programs are
quantitative, not qualitative. The primary disparity is in the relative emphasis
on research. Boulder programs aspire to train producers of research who will
work within academic settings and agencies. Vail programs train consumers of
research and individuals who will be the therapists and supervisors of therapists
in community agencies. The clinical opportunities for licensure and practice are
similar for students in both programs.
Several studies demonstrated that initial worries about stigmatization,
employment difficulties, and licensure uncertainty for PsyDs have never materialized (Hershey, Kopplin, & Cornell, 1991; D. R. Peterson, Eaton, Levine, &
Snepp, 1982). Nor are there discernible differences of late in employment except that the research-oriented, PhD graduates are far more likely to be employed in academic positions and medical schools (Gaddy, Charlot-Swilley,
Nelson, & Reich, 1995).
In terms of application and acceptance rates, PsyD programs average 141
applications and 53 acceptances, but there are significant differences as a result
of institutional location (Norcross, Sayette, & Mayne, 2002). Freestanding programs, on average, receive twice the number of applications as university department programs (with university professional schools in between).
Similarly, the freestanding programs accept significantly more of the applicants
than both types of university-based programs. The average acceptance rate for
PsyD programs is 40% to 41% (i.e., 4 out of 10 applicants to a PsyD program
are accepted). By contrast, the average acceptance rate for clinical PhD programs is 11% to 15% (i.e., 1 or 1.5 out of 10 are accepted).
Student Characteristics
The educational and demographic characteristics of PsyD and PhD students are
similar, but there is an interesting trend across the field. Seventy percent of all
clinical psychology doctoral students are now women, and about 20% are members of ethnic or racial minorities. The one difference between programs is that
The History, Politics, and Social Environment of Clinical Psychology 15
students in PsyD programs are far more likely to have master’s degrees already
(and tend to be older) than PhD students who typically come right from undergraduate programs. About 35% of incoming PsyD students possess a master’s
degree, compared with about 20% in PhD programs (Norcross et al., 2002).
Licensure in Clinical Psychology
It has been said that when psychologists are under attack we circle the wagons
and shoot at each other. To some, this might seem to be the state of affairs in
obtaining the privilege to practice psychology through state licensure. Each
state board of professional psychology maintains its own requirements. Some
use the title “Clinical Psychologist” (e.g., Illinois, which has the designation of
licensed clinical psychologist). Indiana uses the term “Health Service Provider
in Psychology” as the designation for independent practice, and Pennsylvania
has a generic psychology license. The state boards also set minimum requirements (e.g., graduation from an APA accredited program). Some states require
a test on ethics, others an essay examination in research, and others an oral examination before a committee of the board. Some states accept ABPP diploma
status as a credential, whereas others ask that membership in the National Register be a credential for admission to the board process.
However, the good news is that there is a definite trend toward establishing
more consistency and continuity in professional credentialing standards across
states. It only makes sense that professional mobility serves the best interests of
the public. With appropriate checks and balances to address the times when
such mobility might be a risk to the public (e.g., an unscrupulous practitioner is
running away from his or her latest mistakes and seeking a new venue for exploitive or unprofessional practices), qualified providers will be able to practice
in different locations as their lives and interests may take them to new places. To
learn more about licensure and credentialing matters, including the option to
“bank” one’s credentials for mobility across states and future needs, consult the
Association of State and Provincial Psychology Boards (www.asppb.org).
The Practicing Role of a Clinical Psychologist
What is most important for you, our students, is that clinical psychology is constantly changing. By the time you have completed your graduate work (either
PhD or PsyD), the field will have evolved beyond what we describe in this text.
Areas such as clinical health psychology, almost unknown a decade ago, have
become a major emphasis for clinicians. We work with physicians in health
care settings; lawyers in forensic settings; aerospace specialists, who look at behavior in space; and the military, who want to ameliorate the consequences of
training, battle, and homecoming from war.
Today’s practicing clinical psychologist is a primary care provider and can
be likened to a family doctor who treats a variety of problems. Ideally, there is
16 Introduction
no stigma to consulting a clinical psychologist. The clinician offers help with
many challenges in living such as child-rearing issues, school-related problems,
interactions with medical services (pain management, medication compliance),
substance abuse problems, issues in dealing with aging parents, and the full
range of emotional and behavioral disorders. This primary care function does
not mean that every individual enters therapy. Instead, the psychologist may
provide brief consultations (1 to 3 meetings), short-term treatments (3 to 20
visits), or extended intervention as appropriate. A professional relationship
with the psychologist may extend over many years and include multiple family
members. The clinician is a continuing psychological resource, to be consulted
on an “as needed” basis.
Preview of the Text
The following chapters in Part I detail the foundation of clinical psychology. In
Chapter 2, the activities of a clinical psychologist are described in greater detail.
Rather than focusing on a single area, we describe the overall professional culture and its subspecialties. We detail the similarities and differences between
clinical psychology subspecialties such as community psychology, health psychology and behavioral medicine, neuropsychology, forensic psychology, pediatric and child clinical psychology. The emphasis is on the common elements
and relationships of clinical psychologies. In addition, we offer a glimpse into
the lives of contemporary colleagues to provide perspective on living and working as a clinical psychologist.
Chapter 3 emphasizes the importance of understanding cultural differences and similarities when working with diversity. We first define cultural diversity and describe how it can impact—both positively and negatively—our
clinical formulations and interventions. Becoming a sensitive and aware clinician is essential. We explore many psychological processes that influence our
perceptions of culture and diversity, and we offer practical suggestions for integrating what we know about cultural variables into the context of what we do
in clinical settings.
In Chapter 4, we discuss clinical research and outcome assessment in a
highly understandable format. The importance of empirical support for clinical
psychology is discussed. We describe and discuss various research models including experimental, quasi-experimental, observational, and case study designs. The question of how we know which treatments are effective is explored
as we describe an outcome assessment framework for clinical practice.
Chapter 5 explores why (or how) people become patients. What brings
them in? What are they looking for? How has their life circumstance evolved into
one that now is maladaptive at its best and pathological at its most severe? There
are at least 12 common “d” words that describe why people seek therapy. The individual, family, or couple may be: discomforted, discontented, distressed, disabled, dysfunctional, disconnected, dispirited, disgusted, distraught, dissatisfied,
dyscontrolled, and disorganized. This first clinical chapter will discuss the broad
The History, Politics, and Social Environment of Clinical Psychology 17
issues of psychopathology and adaptation that affect the client’s general functioning and quality of life, health, and well-being.
To best understand psychopathology, we use the multiaxial diagnostic systems of DSM-IV-TR (American Psychiatric Association, 2000) and of ICD-10. An
individual is rarely totally pathological or incapacitated. To clarify this issue,
we discuss the interaction of function and psychopathology and how we determine the point at which “normal” behavior becomes pathological. Finally, we
discuss the specific treatment goals of therapy. Are we working to help the
client “feel better,” or is our goal to help the client to “get better?”
In Part II, “Basic Techniques for Clinicians,” we begin our discussion of
clinical issues. (This is really what you came for, isn’t it?) Basic techniques are
considered in two main subsections covering assessment and intervention.
The next three chapters cover the foundation of clinical intervention—the
clinical assessment. The reader becomes firmly grounded in the scientific approach to clinical practice, where the forming of hypotheses and the collection
of data are essential for everything we do. In Chapter 6, we introduce the purpose and goals of clinical assessment, the types of assessments, and the biopsychosocial model for understanding human behavior. This model directs us to
look at the biological/physiological/neurological correlates of behavior as well
as the psychological and social/environmental elements.
In Chapter 7, we continue the scientific approach to assessment, starting
with an explanation of a data-oriented model. Our discussion focuses on structuring the assessor’s critical thinking to be the best consumer of available information, including scientific information on different assessment devices. Using
the scientific method to approach assessment gears the clinician toward hypothesis testing, taking an operational approach to targeted domains, and using
a multimodal, multimethod, time-series assessment, as appropriate.
Chapter 8 continues the discussion of data collection strategies and tools,
taking a closer look at how to build an assessment protocol, how to decide what
needs to be assessed, and how to integrate clinical assessment into clinical practice. We discuss the use and integration of psychological assessment tools
including clinical interviews, psychological testing, observation, report of
significant others, report of other professionals, and self-report. A problemsolving approach to clinical decision making and assessment is emphasized to
assist clinicians in the assessment and treatment process.
Part III addresses the “how to” of psychotherapy. The key issue to be mastered is that of case conceptualization (i.e., building models for understanding
the client and developing appropriate interventions).
In Chapter 9, we focus on developing effective treatment conceptualizations. The highest order skill for the clinician is to develop a treatment model or
conceptualization. We both define and describe the conceptualization process
and describe how the treatment conceptualization informs the treatment plan
throughout therapy.
Chapter 10 explains the next step in therapy, developing the treatment
plan. We emphasize setting collaborative goals as well as developing and maintaining the therapeutic alliance or productive working relationship. Any relationship is filled with pitfalls and problems. The therapeutic relationship is no
18 Introduction
different. We identify the requirements of the therapeutic relationship, describe
techniques for relationship building, and outline some benchmarks of a good
working relationship.
It is hard to build a house without tools. It is equally difficult to build a
therapy without specific methods or tools. In Chapter 11, we discuss specific
methods or tools of intervention that you can add to your psychotherapy skills
repertoire. These methods are grouped according to interpersonal or systems
interventions, affective interventions, behavioral interventions, and cognitive
interventions.
Chapter 12 involves understanding, facilitating, and evaluating change.
We begin by exploring the basic principles of change and the concept of motivation to change. We then look at change in terms of dynamic stages, which helps
us to better understand the many variations in how clients actually make progress toward their goals. Next, we return briefly to the topic of assessment as we
discuss the measurement of change in therapy. Barriers to measuring change in
applied clinical contexts are explained, along with ways to overcome these barriers. Finally, we illustrate the mechanism of communicating about change
with clients, agencies, families, and cooperating professionals.
Next, we take a troubleshooting approach in our discussion of resistance
and impediments to change in Chapter 13. There are several areas of impediment or resistance to change. These include how the patient can be a source of
therapeutic impediment, how the therapist can be a source of therapeutic impediment, how the environment can be a source of therapeutic impediment,
and how the psychological disorder can be a source of therapeutic impediment.
Therapy should not be viewed as a life sentence. In Chapter 14, an effective termination strategy is presented. We illustrate seven types of termination,
on a spectrum from positive to unprofessional. We then explain the professional standards of care for competent termination. In addition, 10 applied
skills for an effective termination are detailed.
In Part IV, Chapter 15, we discuss a frequently avoided but critically important topic. Few careers can be as taxing as clinical psychology. We are dealing with the feelings, actions, problems, traumas, and miseries of others. There
is great weight in what we say and do because our actions have life-altering effects. In this chapter, which focuses on caring for yourself and your colleagues,
we describe therapist burnout. As we consider ways to use positive psychology
in our quest to thrive personally and professionally, we provide access to information on self-care ideas and resources that include the scientific knowledge
generated in our own field.









You have likely decided to pursue graduate studies in clinical psychology
because you are curious about people. You are probably interested in
learning how and why people think, behave, learn, make decisions and judgments, and interact with others the way they do. What accounts for the differences between and among people? Is it biology? Is it environment? Is it
culture? Or is it a combination of variables? You may wonder why some people
function well within their environments and among coworkers, family, and
friends; whereas others have difficulty in similar environments. Perhaps you
want to formally investigate more specific questions relating to these topics, or
you plan to consume information established in the psychology literature so
that you can help people be comfortable with themselves and others. Clinical
psychology is a broad umbrella term for the substantive field of psychology that
addresses such questions.
Learning Objectives
At the end of this chapter, the reader should be able to:
• Describe the elements of a clinical psychology.
• Identify the common elements of the clinical psychologies.
• Discuss the importance of a constant interchange of ideas between clinical
science and the application of that science.
• List at least five fields or specialties of clinical psychology.
• Discuss the ethical obligations specific to declaring a specialty in clinical
psychology.
20 Introduction
The American Psychological Association’s Society of Clinical Psychology
(Division 12) defines the field as follows:
The field of Clinical Psychology integrates science, theory, and practice to understand, predict, and alleviate maladjustment, disability, and discomfort as well
as to promote human adaptation, adjustment, and personal development. Clinical Psychology focuses on the intellectual, emotional, biological, psychological,
social, and behavioral aspects of human functioning across the life span, in
varying cultures, and at all socioeconomic levels (APA, n.d.-b).
Within this definition lie the common threads that tie together the many
specialties of this greater field. A closer look at each aspect of this description throughout the chapters in this book magnifies the fantastic array of
opportunities for individuals trained in clinical psychology and highlights
the necessity for decision making throughout your graduate training.
The goal of this chapter is not just to give you a bird’s eye view of the
field of clinical psychology, but also to help you begin your journey into
that field.
Becoming a clinical psychologist is much more complex than just graduating from a doctoral program (and that alone is no small accomplishment).
Becoming a clinical psychologist requires acculturation to the profession,
and its norms, mores, and customs. Acculturation is defined as “a set of internal psychological outcomes including a clear sense of personal and cultural
identity, good mental health, and the achievement of personal satisfaction
in the new cultural context” (Berry & Sam, 1997, p. 299). Becoming an
ethical psychologist adds another layer to the acculturation process (Handelsman, Gottlieb, & Knapp, 2005) and is even more challenging because the ethical guidelines for practice are sometimes ambiguous. Navigating in a new
culture of an ethical clinical psychology can initially feel like navigating in a
strange land.
This book approaches the field of clinical psychology from your perspective—someone who wants to be a part of this field. Thus, we first aim to guide
you in the understanding of the field of clinical psychology, broadly defined.
Chapter 2 begins with a basic description of the core components: science,
theory, and practice. It orients readers to the focus of clinical psychology,
and the themes that are the underpinnings of each specific chapter that
follows. The remainder of this chapter introduces the many career paths clinical psychologists may take, explains how to gain credentials, experience, and
expertise, and tells you where to find more information about the topics that
interest you. Leaders and exemplars in the field offer their perspectives on
particular areas of specialty and provide recommendations for preparing
yourself to jump in. The descriptions are meant to inspire, interest, and encourage you to talk to practicing professionals throughout your training
so that you can make a well-informed decision about the specialty that best
suits you. Training credentials and pertinent ethical principles are described
in detail.
The Fields of Clinical Psychology 21
Elements of a Clinical Psychology
Science
Clinical psychology has foundations in biological, physical, and social sciences.
Research and investigation in these areas have contributed to the understanding of human functioning at various independent and interacting levels: the
mind-body connection; intellectual functioning; emotional processing; behavior; and the interactions of biological, social, and psychological systems. Science
refers to any knowledge that is based on investigation of relevant phenomena
by empirical methods.
Empirical methods are methods such as observation or experimentation
that are used to identify, study, and test objective phenomena. Naturalistic observation refers to systematically studying a (clinical) phenomenon in its naturally occurring environment, without interference, manipulation, or influence
by the investigator. Experimental techniques entail manipulating (influencing,
controlling) persons, their environment, or some aspect of their biological, psychological, behavioral, or social behaviors. Such observations and experimentation help scientists understand antecedents, consequences, maintaining
variables, and related variables to the phenomena being studied.
Empirical methods, either naturalistic or experimental, usually rely
heavily on operational definitions and replicable techniques that allow for
verification of findings and are grounded in the scientific method. The scientific
method is a core component of a scientific psychology, similar to most sciences. The scientific method has four components: guiding question, hypothesis, experiment or observation to collect data, and interpretation of results
from the experiment. Later in this book, we discuss the scientific approach to
assessment and treatment of persons with clinical problems related to cognitive and behavioral excesses and deficits. Also, more specific empirical methods and techniques used in clinical psychology are discussed in chapters on
clinical research methods, outcome assessment, clinical assessment, and evaluation of change.
Theory
Clinical psychology, like other specialties in psychology, draws on many theories of personality, individual “normal” and abnormal behavior, family systems,
memory, gender differences and feminist perspectives, development, learning,
culture, and other areas of human functioning. A theory is defined as “a general principle formulated to explain a group of related phenomena” (Chaplin,
1985, p. 467). Theories can generally not be proven, and thus, they do not become facts, although scientists often seek to show support for theories.
The difficulty in proving a theory is that human behavior is subject to individual nuances that lead to some exceptions to a particular theory. This does
not mean that a theory does not hold true in the majority of situations, or that
the theory is no longer useful in generally understanding human functioning.
Support for theories can be easy to find, whereas evidence against a particular
22 Introduction
theory may be more difficult to objectively demonstrate. If you had a theory
that persons of your body weight and height could open a 200-pound steel door
by throwing themselves at the door and you could do so freely, you would be
supporting your theory. Supporting your theory that the door could not be
opened by this technique would be more difficult to demonstrate without raising many questions. If you threw your body against the door but could not
open it, you could suggest that you were incapable of opening the door; however, there could be many other reasons you were unable to open the door besides your height, body weight, and technique. Can you think of some of these
reasons? Motivation, effort, force (drawing on physics), location where your
body made contact with the door, and many other possible reasons could explain your lack of success. Also, you could not prove this theory to others because somewhere in the universe might exist someone of your height and
weight who could exercise the same technique and successfully open the door.
As such, you could again lend support to your theory (that persons of your
height and weight can open a 200 pound steel door by throwing your body into
it), but you could not prove this statement as fact.
A large part of what clinical psychologists do and believe about human
functioning and behavior is based on theory—some that is empirically supported, and much that is not. Some specialties within the field of clinical psychology rely more heavily than others on empirically supported or validated
theories and practices. Clinical psychologists and psychologists-in-training are
encouraged to adopt a scientific skeptic’s approach to literature, practice recommendations, and scientific outcome studies that are produced within the
greater field as well as their subdisciplines or specialties. In fact, laypersons also
should be inquisitive and skeptical of theories, practice recommendations, and
published studies from any discipline or field—psychology or others—to ensure
they are wise and discriminating consumers of reputed facts on the information
highways. Such thinking might mitigate the influence of talk-show guests, television or radio hosts, and advice-giving newspaper or magazine columnists
when they share theories with little to no scientific merit. The following subsections define the tenets of clinical psychology.
Practice
Practice, quite simply, usually refers to psychologists putting their knowledge
and skills into use. The practice of clinical psychology may take the form of
teaching clinical psychology foundations, theory, or practice; supervision or
training (of psychologists, trainees, other health or mental health professionals,
laypersons, teachers, police officers, etc.); administration; assessment and treatment; program evaluation/research; and consultation. Some of these roles distinguish clinical psychologists from nondoctoral practitioners or other health
and mental health care professionals. Research on mental health issues, treatment, and best practices is most often accomplished by doctoral-level psychologists and is a core component of clinical psychology practice that differentiates
these experts from others in different fields and professions. Likewise, persons
with master’s degrees may perform some roles and functions of clinical psychologists, but are limited in what they can do compared with doctoral-level
The Fields of Clinical Psychology 23
clinical psychologists (teaching doctoral-level courses, providing independent
assessment and treatment without supervision from a licensed psychologist).
Discussion of these differences is beyond the scope of this chapter, and since
state laws differ, interested readers are directed to the rules and regulations of
practice for their respective states.
The American Psychological Association and other publishers offer journals specific to the roles and functions that represent different areas of clinical
psychologists’ practice. Journals such as Professional Psychology: Research and
Practice; Health Psychology; Clinical Psychology: Science and Practice; Clinical Psychology in Medical Settings; Journal of Personality Assessment; and Rehabilitation Psychology illustrate the integration of science and theory in the application or practice
of the various roles for clinical psychologists. Reviewing a few issues of these
journals might pique your interest in a particular area of clinical psychology
and provide insight into how science and theory influence practice.
Integrating the Elements
Some clinical psychologists focus their work on a specific defining aspect of the
field such as their scientist training. They concentrate on scientific investigation
of clinical phenomena and choose to spend little or no time in clinical/patientcare practice. Other clinical psychologists, though trained in scientific techniques, are solely practitioners and do not engage in scientific investigation at
all. There are even some theoreticians who philosophize, publish, promulgate,
and teach about clinical phenomena, without producing scientific work or engaging in clinical practice. Clinical psychology benefits from professionals who
focus on specific aspects of the disciplines and also from those who attend to the
science, theory, and practice of psychology, as related to clinical phenomena.
We advocate for clinical psychologists to maintain awareness of developing theories, cutting-edge science, and best practices, regardless of their professional work. The American Psychological Association’s and licensing boards’
support and expectation of continuing education for clinical psychologists increase the likelihood of achieving this goal. Those who can balance and integrate these aspects of the field, no matter what their specialty may be, benefit
from the vast array of knowledge available to alleviate clients’ maladjustment
and distress, and increase prosocial and positive functioning, consistent with
the field’s mission.
The mission statement of APA’s Division of Clinical Psychology highlights
the purpose for clinical psychologists’ integration of science, theory, and practice: to understand, predict, and alleviate maladjustment, disability, and discomfort and to promote human adaptation, adjustment, and personal development.
Throughout this book, the scientific, theoretical, and practical approaches to the
understanding and prediction of human behavior are highlighted; specifically,
chapters on clinical research and assessment are designed to deepen your understanding of these concepts. The purpose of alleviating maladjustment, disability, and discomfort differentiates clinical psychology from other disciplines
within psychology, such as industrial/organizational psychology or developmental psychology. Industrial/organizational psychology focuses on industrial
problems concerning employee practices, working conditions, and employment
24 Introduction
rewards and response costs; industrial psychology might also include aspects of
business such as marketing, advertising, and the military (Chaplin, 1985). Developmental psychology focuses on human development, maturation processes,
experiences throughout the life span and their effects on later functioning. Developmental psychologists mostly focus on understanding, theorizing, predicting, and explaining such life events, rather than producing and implementing
interventions for behavior change or alleviating suffering, maladjustment, or
disability. In disciplines like these—in contrast to some aspects of clinical psychology—the focus is not in patient care or individual practice. Yet, child clinical
psychologists would incorporate the learning of developmental psychologists in
their thinking about their patients or research.
Promoting Human Adaptation, Adjustment, and
Personal Development
It is important to note that clinical psychology focuses not only on positive aspects of human behavior and functioning but also on maladaptive behavior,
psychopathology, and personal and interpersonal problems. As stated in Division 12’s mission, the field strives to recognize, increase, and facilitate prosocial
functioning, positive adjustment, and personal development. Some clinical psychologists work exclusively on primary prevention (prevention of disease or illness in susceptible persons); others concentrate on social skills training for
social competence, life skills coaching in areas such as time management, and
optimizing persons’ quality of life, even in the absence of problematic situations, stressors, or clinical problems.
In 2000 and 2001, the inception of the Journal of Positive Psychology and several other articles in the American Psychologist (Fredrickson, 2001; Lyubomirsky,
2001; Masten, 2001; Schneider, 2001; Sheldon & King, 2001) introducing “positive psychology” intended to reorient or remind psychologists across disciplines
that highlighting positive aspects of human functioning instead of deficits or
weaknesses is important in clinical work and scientific research. Sheldon and
King (2001) define positive psychology as the “scientific study of ordinary
human strengths and virtues”; emphasis is on the average person and on effective functioning. They argue that the positive psychology movement contrasts
with traditional negative bias found in many aspects of psychology. In addition to
examples from evolutionary and economic psychology, the authors illustrate
clinical psychology’s focus on psychopathology, and social cognitive psychology’s
attention to biases, negative judgments, and errors in thinking. The Division 12’s
mission statement for clinical psychology states that “promoting human adaptation, adjustment, and personal development” is a goal. Clinicians in their daily
practice should strive to attend to and incorporate knowledge from this pertinent
aspect of the field. Positive psychology is discussed further in Chapter 15 of this
book, “Self-Care and Ethics: Applying the Techniques of Positive Psychology.”
A Focus on Multiple Dimensions of Human Functioning
Clinical psychology recognizes the multidimensional nature of human functioning. To evaluate intellectual, emotional, biological, psychological, social and be-
The Fields of Clinical Psychology 25
havioral aspects of human functioning as independent components would provide a narrow and likely inaccurate view of an individual or persons. Therefore,
a multidimensional approach to research, assessment, treatment, and understanding of individuals, person-environment, and person-person relationships
is required. Throughout this book, we highlight the multidimensional approach
to understanding people, their strengths, weaknesses, excesses, and deficits. In
clinical psychology, the various facets of human functioning are studied across
the life span, and within the context of various cultures and socioeconomic levels. Where possible, these distinctions are illustrated.
Training Qualifications and Ethics Regulations
Training and qualifications such as coursework, certificate or degree requirements, and years and type of experience differ for various specialties. Description of each specialty’s requirements is beyond the scope of this chapter. There
are, however, basic qualifications that are common to all clinical psychologies,
which include a bachelor degree, a doctoral degree, and predoctoral internship.
Postdoctoral supervised training and licensure are optional for some careers
that are not oriented toward independent service delivery. Continuing education credits are another state-legislated requirement of all licensed professionals. Board certification distinguishes specialists from general practitioners, and
this credential is discussed. The APA Ethics Code is critical to self-regulating
one’s professional activity and testimony of specialty, so relevant principles in
the Code are described.
Doctoral Degree
Individuals must obtain their doctoral degree to be eligible to become a clinical
psychologist. Master’s degrees are often awarded during the course of doctoral
training, and some terminal master’s degrees are granted in the field of clinical
psychology. However, the master’s degree does not permit the use of the title
“clinical psychologist,” nor does it allow for independent practice specifically in
this field. (Master’s level therapists can earn some licenses that are titled “counselor,” or something similar.) To become a clinical psychologist requires training in a Doctor of Philosophy (PhD), a Doctor of Psychology (PsyD), or a Doctor
of Education (EdD) program focusing on applied clinical psychology. The
American Psychological Association accredits programs in psychology, and this
accreditation is critical to ensure one’s doctoral degree will likely transfer from
state to state and be accepted by state licensing boards. There are, however, excellent programs that are not yet eligible for APA accreditation because they are
new or do not intend to train practitioners and deem this certification unnecessary. Applicants should always inquire about APA status and the limits to licensure and practice in the local and distant areas if a program is not accredited.
The most common doctoral training programs, PhD, PsyD, and EdD, are described to clarify the similarities and differences in the degrees and career options available.
26 Introduction
Doctorate of Philosophy (in Clinical Psychology)
A PhD program typically follows the Boulder Model of training to produce
scientist-practitioners on graduation. The Boulder Model is so named after
the seminal conference held in Boulder, Colorado, in 1949 that defined the
research-practice emphasis desired in PhD programs. PhD programs are usually housed in university settings. Fewer students are accepted in these programs than in PsyD or EdD programs because students are usually required to
work in a faculty member’s research lab for the duration of their graduate
training and are paid a stipend or tuition remission for doing so. PhD programs
traditionally emphasize research training more than practitioner-oriented programs. The core belief in the Boulder Model of training is that clinical psychologists must be producers of research and science to be skilled users of research
and current knowledge. Thus, the exchange between practice and research is
deemed critical to advance the field. However, the degree to which any program prepares individuals for careers in any of the subspecialties or for research, teaching, administration, or clinical work varies greatly.
PhD programs are typically designed to be completed in an average of 5 to
7 years postundergraduate degree. Some require the completion of a terminal
master’s degree and some field experience prior to admission. Entrance into
doctoral programs is very competitive. Acceptance may be even more competitive than most medical schools since there are often only a few seats available
and many competitive applicants for each entry class.
Doctorate of Psychology in Clinical Psychology
The PsyD programs ascribe to the Vail Model of training. This model was so
named after a 1973 meeting that was funded by the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) to explore the alternative training models that would accommodate the changing needs and demands of society. A doctoral level
alternative to the PhD, the PsyD, was endorsed. This training model prepares
individuals to be practitioner-scholars. The National Council of Schools and
Programs of Professional Psychology (NCSPP) put forth a recommended core
curriculum for professional psychology training programs that includes the following competencies: Relationship, Intervention, Assessment, Research and
Evaluation, Consultation and Education, and Management and Supervision
(R. L. Peterson et al., 1992), and Diversity was later added. The PsyD programs,
while needing to justify their curriculum to meet APA standards, do not have
the same governing curricular guidelines.
Unless you have enrolled in a PsyD program, you may be surprised to
learn that PsyD graduate students have coursework and some requirements in
research as well. Many aspiring psychologists erroneously believe that research
skills differentiate PsyD from PhD graduates. This may be true to some degree
for career paths and training emphasis, but it is inaccurate to say that PsyD students do not acquire research skills. The type of research that is commonly conducted differs, although this is not necessary. The research of PsyD students
frequently involves studying “local science,” or examining phenomena in clinical practice or the community, more than benchmark research of underlying
psychological processes and principles. Qualitative research and case studies
are common methodologies for completion of a PsyD dissertation study,
The Fields of Clinical Psychology 27
whereas quantitative observational and outcomes research might be more
common in scientist-practitioner training programs.
Doctorate of Education
Doctorates of Education (EdD) are recipients of degrees that focus on counselor
education. Most psychologists with an EdD work in school or educational settings, but some also work in agency counseling or community counseling settings. EdD psychology programs typically have less emphasis on research than
psychology programs, and typically less coursework and practical experience in
psychological assessment, intervention, and psychopathology. Assessment skills
gained are often more psychoeducational and occupational, instead of focusing
on personality or psychopathology. However, EdD students are usually eligible
to compete for internships in clinical psychology, in which case they can gain
assessment and intervention skills, and subsequent requirements necessary for
independent practice.
Predoctoral Internship
All doctoral programs leading toward qualification as a clinical psychologist require a predoctoral internship training year prior to awarding the doctoral degree. Clinical psychology predoctoral internships are full-time programs for 1
year, or part-time programs for 2 years, in which students function as a practicing psychologist under the supervision of a licensed psychologist. Students
often leave their home base training program to seek supplemental or altogether new training in a clinical practice of their choice. Predoctoral internships
occur in any of the various settings previously discussed, or in a combination of
settings. Interns may specialize in a particular area of patient care (e.g., severe
mental illness, acute care), or seek general training. Predoctoral internships
should have weekly seminars and didactics, and ongoing supervision of all professional activities. This training experience usually is the culmination of the
doctoral degree, unless outstanding dissertation work needs to be completed.
Most programs permit or encourage students to seek internships through
the Association of Psychology and Postdoctoral Internship Centers (APPIC).
This national organization lists qualified internship and postdoctoral training
sites, and serves to match sites with applicants according to a two-way ranking
system. It is one of the predominant affiliations that clinical psychologists recognize as certification that a predoctoral training program is of sufficient rigor
and breadth in experience. The APA also accredits internships, and training in
an APPIC or APA-accredited internship is essential for licensure in many states,
or for obtaining some academic jobs. A challenge in the field is that there is a
national shortage of APA-accredited internships compared with the number of
graduate students in need of training. Some policymakers in the field, therefore, advocate granting degrees and making the internship year a postdoctoral,
postdegree requirement.
Postdoctoral Fellowships and Postdoctoral Training
On completion of the doctoral degree, the doctoral degree recipient is ready to
practice psychology, right? This is not exactly the case. Graduates of doctoral
28 Introduction
programs who want to practice clinical psychology must obtain supervised
postdoctoral training to be eligible for state licensure. Postdoctoral fellowships
or internships can be similar to predoctoral internships; few of them, however,
are part of a regular postdoctoral training program and they are not regulated
by the degree-granting institution. The number of hours required, or what
constitutes appropriate training experiences, varies by state. Fulfilling this
training requirement can be a challenge because graduates may have outstanding debts to pay from graduate school, and the income earned by most postdoctoral fellows or interns is substantially less than that of a regularly practicing professional. Postdoctoral fellows need supervision and may be limited in
their ability to bill fully for services. However, if you were to ask graduates of
doctoral programs if they would want to skip their postdoctoral training year
and immediately become solely responsible for their work, many would say
“no!” There is much to learn about practicing as a clinical psychologist, whether
it is how to write research grants, how to enlist oneself on insurance panels or
market a private practice, or how to obtain privileges in a neighborhood hospital. The postdoctoral training year transitions graduates into their role as a full
professional by teaching them essential skills through apprenticeship and training, and initiates a career-long practice of peer consultation and support.
Licensure
Each state controls and regulates the privilege to practice psychology. Licensure
is an individual qualification that is obtained through state regulatory boards.
Practitioners must be licensed to practice independently and use the title “psychologist.” Licensed psychologists must meet the following minimal requirements: (a) a doctoral degree in a psychology or psychology-related field, (b) 1
year of predoctoral supervised clinical work, (c) 1 year of postdoctoral supervised clinical work, (d) a passing score on the national standardized exam (the
Examination for Professional Practice in Psychology, or EPPP), and (e) any state
mandated standardized, written, or oral examination on state law and professional ethics. Licensure is a quality control mechanism that ensures the minimum standards have been met for the privilege of calling oneself a psychologist.
Licensure only regulates the use of the title “psychologist,” not “clinical
psychologist” or “clinical health psychologist,” or even “forensic psychologist.”
Licensure is general, and the description of one’s practice is self-regulated and
dictated by the legal and ethical standards set forth by the state and profession.
Essentially, the psychologist is held responsible for “truth in packaging.” One
must be qualified as competent on the basis of training, education, and experience to offer either general or specialized psychological services. Thus, calling
oneself a clinical psychologist requires appropriate licensure as a psychologist,
and credentials in clinical psychology (doctorate, internships, and postdoctoral
training). This quality control mechanism and state regulations are in place to
protect the public from unqualified practitioners putting themselves forward as
something they are not, and ensuring that those who are psychologists meet the
minimal standards set forth at the time of licensure and throughout their
tenure in the field. Those who engage in unqualified practice, either by misusing the title or misusing a method or procedure due to incompetence, negli-
The Fields of Clinical Psychology 29
gence, or willful disregard of the law can be subject to legal sanctions for unprofessional conduct.
Continuing Education
State licensing boards mandate psychologists to complete a certain number of
continuing education credits per license cycle (usually 2 years). Continuing education requirements were developed to ensure that psychologists maintain
some degree of currency with movements and training in the field. Almost all
states require some portion of the continuing education requirement to include
ethics workshops or training. What constitutes credit varies to allow scholars,
practitioners, and researchers to obtain credits in their area of expertise. In
Pennsylvania, individually publishing a research article counts for 10 continuing education credit hours; the credit for coauthoring an article is calculated by
dividing 10 hours by the number of authors.
Teaching classes, attending workshops, completing online courses, turning
in quizzes from current research articles, or at-home study can all count toward continuing education credit in most states. State boards randomly audit
individual psychologists to ensure compliance with this law. Review requires
psychologists to produce their continuing education certificates and verification of fulfilling the requirements.
Board Certification
Psychologists can and are encouraged to seek certification or a diploma in one
of the specialties recognized by the American Board of Professional Psychology
(ABPP).
This board is independent of the American Psychological Association, but
was incorporated with their help in 1947. This governing body protects the public
by ensuring and certifying individuals’ qualifications and skills to deliver services
and practice within a designated specialty area. According to ABPP, a specialty
area is a “defined area in the practice of psychology that connotes special competency acquired through an organized sequence of formal education, training, and
experience” (ABPP, n.d.). The ABPP awards diplomas, resulting in one becoming a
“diplomate,” based on a thorough review of credentials (doctoral training, license,
appropriate internship and postdoctoral training), self-statement, work samples,
and an oral examination by existing board members.
ABPP recognizes the following specialties through Member Boards: child
and adolescent psychology, cognitive and behavioral psychology, clinical psychology, clinical health psychology, clinical neuropsychology, counseling psychology,
family psychology, forensic psychology, group psychology, psychoanalysis, rehabilitation psychology, school psychology, and organization and business. While
board certification to date is only sought by approximately 10% of licensed psychologists, it is becoming more important for financial reimbursement from insurance companies, reciprocity between state licensing boards, and distinction
among colleagues in an ever-growing competitive profession. Outside the field of
psychology, medical and forensic colleagues perhaps are most likely to look for
this credential when collaborating, referring to, or seeking psychologists.
30 Introduction
Respecialization
Psychologists who want to shift the focus of their practice after completing their
training are expected to seek necessary education, training, consultation, or supervision from others with the desired expertise. For complete respecialization,
psychologists can enroll in formal training programs to complete portions of a
clinical degree that pertain to their area of interest. Psychologists may choose to
do additional practicums or internships or take relevant coursework in neuropsychology if their original training was in clinical child psychology. Some
programs may award certificates of respecialization, but the preparation to shift
or designate focus in one’s practice is largely self-governed by following the
ethics code.
Ethics Guidelines
An old adage suggests, “A wise man knows what he knows, and knows what he
doesn’t know.” This could not be truer than in the self-evaluation and selfpromotion of one’s clinical abilities in psychology. By-and-large, clinical psychology is a self-regulated field to the extent that practitioners must meet the
minimal competency standards for training qualifications and emotional wellbeing necessary for practice in their designated area. Emotional well-being is
discussed in detail in Chapter 15, and therefore, only competence in training is
addressed here.
Competency in psychology is accomplished by completion of doctoral
training, supervised postdoctoral hours, licensure, and continuing education
credits. The monitoring of a person’s competency or skill becomes a more diffuse process following licensure. Becoming a licensed professional offers a high
degree of independence, even among those who work in a hierarchical organization such as a hospital or clinic where there may be quality oversight through
various mechanisms. To protect the public from clinicians who might allow
their skills to erode or become obsolete by failing to keep up with new developments, the state regulatory boards generally mandate a certain amount of regular continuing education for all health-related professionals as a minimum
effort for maintaining competence. So, if psychologists have a current license
and complete the requisite number of continuing education credits, they are
theoretically competent to practice as they see fit, within the guidelines of the
American Psychological Association’s Ethics Code (2002). But to truly become
and remain competent, professional psychologists must acquire a great deal of
specialized knowledge, clinical experience, and a strong set of skills for selfcontrol and self-regulation.
Specialties in Clinical Psychology
Specialists in clinical psychology focus their careers on working with a particular age group or diagnosis, with a specific population, in a select setting, or
with emphasis on a type of therapeutic modality, or stage of intervention.
Some combination of these parameters can also be chosen to create unique and
The Fields of Clinical Psychology 31
valued specialties. Examples of these specialties are described, and those that
are most common are highlighted with descriptions of associated organizations, and professional groups, and by snapshots of days in the life of professionals practicing in their fields.
Specialties across the Life Span
To think of any major mind-body function or aspect of psychology across the
biopsychosocial model in reference to a 5-year-old versus a 50-year-old, most
would agree that even similar functions and processes are different between
the two. Communication, thought and reasoning processes, expression and
experience of emotion, physical responses to stressors, social relations, perception and experience of one’s environment, and even the types of psychopathology manifested differ across the life span. Clinical psychologists need to be
experts in normal and abnormal psychological human functioning for the population with which they work. Although some psychologists adopt a generalist
approach that allows them to work with patients across the life span, these professionals likely have other limits to their practice because they cannot address
the gamut of all issues for all patients. Three specialties that are recognized
within the field are clinical child and adolescent psychology, pediatric psychology, and
clinical geropsychology.
The focus of the specialty in clinical child and adolescent psychology, as
described by the mission statement of Division 53 of the American Psychological Association, is on the scientific, training, practice, and professional aspects
of “furthering knowledge, welfare, and mental health of children, youth,
and families” (Masten, 2001). Child psychologists often have more expertise in
behavioral analysis; assessment and intervention; intellectual assessment; play
therapy; and milieu or home-based evaluation than general practitioners. Child
psychologists can maintain any theoretical orientation in their practice of therapy or scientific research. However, behavioral assessment and intervention are
preferred approaches for many child problems and disorders.
The Association for Behavioral and Cognitive Therapies (ABCT) has Special Interest Groups (SIG) that bring together professionals who subdivide the
specialty of clinical child and adolescent psychology even further. Relating to
child and adolescent psychology, ABCT’s Special Interest Groups include “Parenting and Families”; “Cognitive Behavioral Therapy in School Settings”;
“Child and School Related Disorders”; “Child Maltreatment and Violence”;
and “Child and Adolescent Anxiety.” Child and adolescent psychologists can
choose to focus on any and all aspects of clinical psychology as previously defined (science, theory, practice). Child and adolescent psychologists may work
in a large variety of settings, such as academic institutions, psychiatric facilities, administrative organizations, or private practice. Some child psychologists work in hospital settings and focus on the health, physical illness, and
well-being of children and adolescents and are typically classified as “pediatric psychologists.”
The Society of Pediatric Psychology was founded in 1968, and is a division of the American Psychological Association (Division 54). Scientists and
professionals practicing pediatric psychology focus on health care of children,
32 Introduction
adolescents, and their families. Practitioners of pediatric psychology work in
interdisciplinary settings such as family medicine practices, children’s hospitals, developmental clinics, academic settings, or traditional child psychology
venues. Pediatric psychology is actually a subspecialty of behavioral medicine
and health psychology, and perhaps represents the interface between health
psychology and clinical psychology focusing on children, adolescents, and
families. Pediatric psychologists work to address such issues as coping with
chronic illnesses, behavioral change for prevention or maintenance of child or
adolescent weight gain/loss, preparation for surgical or medical procedures,
psychological development of children who have chronic or acute medical illnesses, head traumas, or physical disabilities. Clinical and research areas of
interest may focus on crises, prevention, assessment, intervention, maintenance, or all those issues. Professionals in this field also address children or
adolescents within the context of their family, and aid parents and siblings in
coping and adjusting to the identified patient’s needs, lifestyle, or psychological changes. Pediatric psychologists often offer services to these constituents
directly as well. Dr. Anne Kazak is a nationally and internationally known pediatric psychologist. She shares her perspectives on the field and her career in

I am a clinical psychologist whose work is at the intersection of pediatric and family
psychology. I am a professor in the Department of Pediatrics at the University of Pennsylvania and Director of the Department of Psychology and Deputy Director of the Behavioral Health Center at the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia (CHOP). CHOP is a
The Fields of Clinical Psychology 33
large, academic pediatric center. In my current position, I spend one third of my time in
administration (overseeing a department of approximately 60 doctoral level psychologists and collaborating with others through our academic medical center to develop and
sustain behavioral programs) and two thirds in a variety of research and mentoring activities with local, national, and international foci. My lab is currently organized
around two federal research grants from the National Cancer Institute addressing the
development of interventions for children with cancer and their families. I also serve as
a mentor to postdoctoral fellows, and psychologists and pediatricians. I do not see patients at the present time. Currently, I am the editor of the Journal of Family Psychology
and a past editor of the Journal of Pediatric Psychology. And I am active nationally in the
American Psychological Association (APA), now as past president of the Society of Pediatric Psychology (SPP) and chair of an APA task force on Evidence Based Practice for
Children and Adolescents.
A Day in the Life of Dr. Kazak
I get up between 6:00 and 6:30. I’m usually the first one up and initiate the morning
routines for our Rhodesian Ridgeback (Bella) and cat (Moxiefe). I eat breakfast with
my partner (Chris) and 4.5-year-old son (Sam), catch a bit of news from the newspaper
or the television and pack lunch. At some point before leaving for work, I generally
peek at my e-mail. I drive to work (about 30 minutes door to door), sometimes dropping Sam off at preschool.
My day at work is split between research and administrative responsibilities. I’m usually at work between 8:00 and 8:30 and leave between 5:00 and 5:30. I generally do not
take time for lunch unless I am having a business lunch. It’s difficult to say what a typical day is like because they are quite variable, some spent more in administrative responsibilities and others more focused on research or mentoring. There is a lot of time
at home spent on work, on evenings and weekends. Some typical examples during a
workday include:
• Meetings with other staff about administrative matters related to the Department of Psychology or the Behavioral Health Center: These may include discussions of programmatic and/or budgetary planning, staff recruitment, development and review of
policies or topics such as planning around space or other resources, quality improvement, or regulatory issues. There are often conversations that might be
broadly described as “problem-solving,” whether around a clinical issue and a
specific patient situation, or to figure out how to best accomplish goals related
to projects and initiatives.
• Meetings with research staff to review projects and detailed discussions about study progress and difficulties encountered in projects: Our clinical research involves the development and delivery of clinical services to patients and families, so these
sessions may include review of tapes of sessions and discussions of our impressions of the treatments and their impact. Depending on the phase of a project,
we may also be reviewing results and discussing next steps for data analysis.
I enjoy writing and value this as one of the most important aspects of my professional
life. Often there is at least one manuscript in preparation and/or a grant that is being
written or revised. I am also frequently reading and editing work that is being written
34 Introduction
collaboratively with others or papers from trainees. In order to facilitate the process of
writing, I take occasional days for working at home. These days, with less distraction,
are critical to my productivity. It’s also common that I come into the office for a couple
of hours on Saturday mornings to write.
The process of running a research lab and conducting research entails meetings and
materials to review related to potential new projects and collaborations. It’s not unusual, to attend a meeting with a group of potential collaborators, anticipating the
submission of a new grant proposal or exploring ideas for collaborative efforts. Related to this category of activity, I’m also commonly addressing questions from people
at CHOP, nationally and internationally about research projects and potential collaborations. More and more conference calls are used to facilitate collaborations across
institutions. It’s also common to meet with mentees to discuss projects or professional development issues. And, research has administrative activities, so phone calls
with our business administrator or completion of paperwork related to grants is also
common.
As a journal editor, I work with my journal assistant to assure that submitted manuscripts are entered properly through the electronic journal management system, that
reviewers are identified and assigned to papers and that we can track the flow of papers
through the editorial process. I am almost always carrying with me the materials to
write at least one editorial letter. There are also publishing deadlines to meet in order to
produce each issue of the journal and numerous questions, some easy, some more
complex, from authors and reviewers that I answer almost everyday.
E-mail is a key component of all of my activities. The amount of e-mail can be considerable and involves “conversations” about many administrative issues from many individuals in the Hospital and information about research studies and questions from
team members. I’m “copied” on many conversations which helps keep me informed
about a variety of issues of concern. Nationally, I receive e-mail from a variety of listservs and communications from people around the world about research projects and
other national activities.
I usually pick up Sam at his babysitter’s. I’m a runner and try to run in the neighborhood several nights a week before dinner, if it fits with everyone’s schedules and plans
for the evening. We eat dinner as a family, often with a friend joining us. After dinner,
we relax and play. I’m often back on the computer later in the evening, mostly doing email, journal work, and finishing up some work from the day. I’m usually relaxing and
settling down for the night by 10.
Dr. Kazak Provides the Following Recommendations for Persons Interested in
Joining Her Field
There will be many opportunities in child health. A strong grounding in clinical, child,
and family psychology during training is important as is seeking out experiences in pediatric settings. A breadth of experiences is important, including skills in clinical services, research and teaching. People with the ability to be flexible, who can work as
members and leaders of teams, and those who can readily see opportunities that transcend traditional disciplinary boundaries will continue to be very competitive in pediatric psychology.
The Fields of Clinical Psychology 35
Clinical geropsychology maintains the same general mission as all fields of
clinical psychology with intention to further develop science, practice, and theory. This subspecialty focuses on the mental health of older adults and psychological service delivery for them. Section 2 (Clinical Geropsychology) of the
Society of Clinical Psychology (Division 12 of APA) is an organization dedicated to furthering this mission.
The meaning of the term older adults has changed over time, as general life
expectancy and the population of older individuals have increased. Now, psychologists have come to address different adult populations as the “young old”
for persons aged 65 to 74 years, “old old” for persons aged 75 to 85 years, and
“oldest old” for persons aged 85 years and older (Santrock, 1999). These distinctions are helpful in recognizing that different cohorts of individuals might
have similar experiences within groups, but not across groups.
In comparison to younger adults, the psychological care of older adults coinciding with normative or age-expected life events often requires greater attention to medically related problems, medication use and compliance,
medication or substance abuse, differential diagnoses (e.g., Alzheimer’s disease
versus Depression), neuropsychological phenomena, systemic issues (e.g.,
nursing or assisted home care, family involvement; insurance), and death and
dying issues. Generational experiences (cohort effects) and age-related cultural
variables are also critical considerations for the optimal care of this population.
Since older adults have increasingly become a more prevalent population in the
workforce and in the care for younger generations, attention to these issues as
they relate to older adults’ beliefs and cohort experiences also require psychologists to have specialty knowledge and sensitivity.
Empirically based protocols for the treatment of many psychological disorders are geared toward the general adult population. Research not specifically
targeting senior adults tends to focus on persons between the ages of 18 and 65:
18 as a lower limit to avoid difficulties in obtaining informed consent; 65 as
upper limit probably because this is the age of retirement and a marker for differential experiences between those older and younger. Also, it had been assumed
that psychotherapeutic interventions for older adults do not need to differ from
those of the average population (Thorp & Lynch, 2005), but practitioners find this
not to be true. Clinical geropsychologists have dedicated much effort to the modification of protocols intended for younger adults, and the development, testing,
and validation of new assessment tools and techniques, and interventions for
older adults. More work is needed in this area. Also, topics such as the impact of
social support, methods and location of treatment delivery, and patient and therapist variables related to the treatment and care of older adults need further exploration (Thorp & Lynch, 2005). Research on caregivng has also expanded to
investigate the impact of senior adult spouses caring for their partners as well as
caregivng issues specific to adult children, family members, and professionals.
Specialties by Disorder
Many practitioners and researchers specialize their practices by focusing on
populations of individuals who have their psychological disorders or intervention needs in common. In community mental health centers and primary care
36 Introduction
facilities, this practice is not always feasible; but in private practices and academic research, this tends to be the norm rather than the exception. Niche
practices can help practitioners secure a continual stream of referrals, and help
researchers make a significant impact in the identification, assessment, treatment, or advancement of theory for a target group.
The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-IV-TR; American Psychiatric Association, 1994) made categorization of individuals discrete
to distinguish between types of problems experienced by patients, although
many patients have coexisting disorders and problems. Practice directories,
training directories, and associations tend to index psychologists’ expertise according to DSM disorders and additional subgroups. Some psychologists primarily treat individuals with mood disorders, whereas others predominantly work
with patients who have personality disorders. Psychologists may specialize in
substance abuse, sexual dysfunctions, developmental disabilities, or neuropsychological disorders. In Box 2.2, Dr. Ronald Fudge, the Director of Substance
Abuse Services in a metropolitan VA hospital, explains his roles, responsibilities, and recommendations for this area of clinical practice and research.
Box 2.2 Highlights of a Contemporary Psychologist
Ronald C. Fudge, PhD
Dr. Fudge holds a doctoral degree from University of Georgia, and master’s
degrees from University of Bridgeport and Princeton University (psychophysiology). His predoctoral internship was in the New Jersey state psychology internship program, and his postdoctoral training was in Detroit, where he
continued psychophysiology and biofeedback training and research. He is currently licensed in the state of New York, and is an active member of the American Psychological Association and the Association for Behavioral and
Cognitive Therapies. While Dr. Fudge subscribes to Cognitive and Behavioral Therapy, and
the Journal of Consulting and Clinical Psychology, he has access to a vast library of substance abuse journals and other relevant titles in his workplace. He routinely attends APA and
ABCT conferences, and occasionally attends conferences of the Association of Black Psychologists,
and other meetings in New York City. Dr. Fudge explains his roles and responsibilities in his position as Director of Substance Abuse Services in a VA Hospital.
My current position is the Director of Substance Abuse Services in a metropolitan VA hospital. Substance abuse services include a residential program for individuals with severe
addiction problems and moderate or chronic medical issues. There is also an intensive
outpatient program that includes evenings and weekends, a methadone maintenance
clinic, a community outreach program located in several venues throughout New Jersey,
and a consultation and liaison service within the medical specialty hospital. As Director, I
am responsible for a staff of 25 people that include administrative assistants, Psychologists, Psychiatrist, Internists, a physician assistant, rehab techs, nurses, and social workers.
Job responsibilities and duties are wide ranging and at times challenging. As Overall
Director, I am responsible for program development and supervising the provision of
The Fields of Clinical Psychology 37
services. While a considerable amount of time is dedicated to administrative and related services, I also provide clinical oversight and supervision. Since the “buck” stops
at my desk, final clinical decisions are my responsibility. I also chair interdisciplinary
team meetings, supervise intakes, and act as community liaison in public affairs. It is
also part of my role as administrator to determine, monitor, and maintain the quality
of services. I also serve as the Mental Health Program Analyst ensuring the maintenance of departmental standards.
Probably the most enjoyable part of the position aside from direct clinical services is the
provision of supervision and training for Psychology and Social work interns, Medical
Students, and Residents. When time permits, I have provided supervision and collaboration on research and dissertation projects.
What makes the job most interesting is the challenge of serving a diverse population
with a wide variety of issues both prior to and as a result of substance abuse. Their
problems are often complicated by medical issues either as a result of substance use or
from other causes. The challenge comes in affecting their lives in a very short period of
time. Regardless of misconceptions about substance abuse, marked psychological and
physical changes do result from treatment. The diverse etiologies and variety of people
with substance abuse problems call for a wide variety of clinical skills.
What Does Dr. Fudge Find to Be His Biggest Challenges in His Specialty or Position?
Substance abuse is closely related to the economy and the individual’s perception of
their place in society. In trying to provide treatment we are often faced with the interaction of poverty, childhood, and sexual abuse, racism, and the vagaries of economics.
I have often seen patients make major changes in their life only to be faced with the
hopelessness of their previous environment. It is difficult for some in this society where
some live very well and others have nothing and little hope for any change. When you
add in the devastating effect that substance abuse has on the physiognomy, permanent
positive change is extremely difficult.
What Does Dr. Fudge Like the Least about His Area of Specialty or Current Position?
As an administrator I am often faced with the sometimes contradictory goals presented
by the clinical needs of the client population and the administration and economic concerns of the organization. While it is not always the case that these two interests diverge, it occurs often enough to be a source of regular irritation. Additionally, there is
in substance abuse a conflict between the traditional view of substance abuse treatment, which is often based on experiential considerations, and the application of more
empirically tested interventions. I have been fortunate to have a fairly enlightened staff
that is open to almost any approach. In some other facilities, there is what amounts to
open warfare over treatment philosophy and goals.
A Day in the Life of Dr. Fudge
Dr. Fudge enjoys a full day beginning at 5 A.M. until he retires at 11 P.M. The bulk of his
professional work occurs between 7 A.M. and 4 P.M. In addition to his responsibilities
detailed previously, his day includes a 30- to 50-minute commute to or from work,
coaching several nights a week, household duties and family time, and time to practice
music, read, and “veg” in front of the “tube.”
38 Introduction
Dr. Fudge Provides the Following Recommendations for Persons Interested in
Joining His Field
First, I think that one should have a thorough understanding of the physiology of addiction, particularly the long-term effects of addiction and abuse. As new research on addiction and substance abuse emerges, the role of neurological changes needs to be
incorporated with behavior change. An awareness of a societal bias against substance
abusers is also important. There is a broad-based view that substance abusers are either
weak willed, or deficient in some way that allows them to become addicted to drugs.
Many in mental health often feel that working with substance abusers is the bottom of
the barrel.
Second, a more than passing acquaintance with medicine is something that a welltrained psychologist needs, especially in substance abuse. After 27 years in the field, I
feel that psychologists need to have a better background in physiology and a familiarity
with the psychological effects of medical problems. This should include enough lay
medicine to understand basic lab values and the behavioral consequences of medications and abnormal conditions. Anyone in the field should have enough of a medical
vocabulary and understanding to follow most medical charts. A medical dictionary and
Physician’s Desk Reference should be part of the psychologist’s library.
Many organizations coalesce their members around particular mental
health disorders or clinical health psychology topics. There are national organizations that focus on science, theory, and practice surrounding one or more diagnostic category: Anxiety Disorders Association of America, the Association for
the Treatment of Sexual Abusers, the Association for the Advancement of Mental Retardation, the Society of Behavioral Medicine, and the Treatment and Research Association (TARA) for Personality Disorders. This is only a small
sampling of the specialties categorized in this way. The Association for Behavioral and Cognitive Therapies (ABCT) has Special Interest Groups (SIGs) in the
organization that also have organized interested members around diagnostic
categories, in addition to other categories. A sampling of the SIGs include the
following: Addictive Behaviors, Anxiety Disorders, Child and School-Related Issues, Developmental Disabilities, Insomnia and Other Sleep Disorders, Obesity
and Eating Disorders, Schizophrenia and Other Serious Mental Disorders. There
are Divisions in the American Psychological Association that focus on diagnostic
groups (e.g., personality, addictions) as well; however, these groups may not
focus exclusively on the criteria of clinical psychology. Associations relevant to
specialties in clinical psychology can be found in the Appendix (p. 53).
Clinical Health Psychology
Clinical psychologists whose distinct focus is on physical health problems and
the maintenance of physical health specialize in clinical health psychology. This
specialty attends to the interface between behavior and health. Clinical health
psychologists adopt a biopsychosocial model of health and illness and believe
that attention to the mind-body relationship is critical to physical and mental
well-being. This field aims to apply scientific knowledge to “the promotion and
The Fields of Clinical Psychology 39
maintenance of health; the prevention, treatment and rehabilitation of illness
and disability; and the improvement of the health care system” (APA, 1997).
Services are provided to families, individuals, and the organization of health
care systems. Hospitals, medical practices (primary care and specialty practices), nursing homes, outpatient clinics, and rehabilitation centers are settings
in which clinical health psychologists might work.
Clinical health psychologists could ascribe to any theoretical orientation.
Most research in this field, however, promotes cognitive and behavioral approaches to resolving, stabilizing, minimizing, or preventing problems. Most
service is delivered in short-term individual psychotherapy, consultation, psychoeducation, or group formats. Services are also likely to be developed
through multidisciplinary collaboration or coordination of care. Organizations
that advance clinical health psychology practices and research include ABCT’s
Special Interest Group in Behavioral Medicine, the Society of Behavioral Medicine, and APA’s Division 38, Health Psychology.
Clinical health psychologists are involved in physical health care in research and clinical endeavors. They may help with any of the following problems: behavioral and psychological risk factors for disease, illness, or injury;
psychological factors secondary to disease, illness, or injury; somatic presentations of psychological disorders; and behavioral and psychological aspects of
medical procedures such as surgery, chemotherapy, and dental work in need of
attention because of the way psychological phenomena are thought to impact
physical health, or vice versa (Golden & Felgoise, 2005). Areas in which clinical health psychologists have had significant impact on the fields of medicine
and health care include obesity and eating disorders, oncology, HIV/AIDS, gastroenterology, cardiology, organ transplant, surgery, pain management, smoking and respiration (asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [COPD]),
sleep medicine, and fertility and sexual functioning. In fact, clinical health psychology has made inroads in helping people deal with illness and maintenance
of health for all organ systems. Services are also often provided to family members who are either caring for persons with medical illnesses or are affected by
their loved ones’ health status.
Clinical Neuropsychology
Clinical neuropsychology is another specialty that warrants specific discussion
when considering focal areas in terms of disorder. Clinical neuropsychology
can be classified under the umbrella of clinical psychology, but is also recognized as a specialty of psychology (APA’s Division 40) in its own right. Clinical
neuropsychologists often differentiate themselves from clinical psychologists
although some engage in both general clinical psychology and neuropsychology
practice.
Clinical neuropsychology focuses on the scientific study of “brainbehavior relationships, and the clinical application of that knowledge to
human problems” (APA, Division 40, www.div40.org/body.html). The mission of the APA Division of Clinical Neuropsychology is to “promote the use
of scientific research to develop its knowledge base and clinical techniques,”
and to develop and promote “quality standards of professional training and
40 Introduction
practice” (Barr & Cole, 2007). Division 40 broadens the focus on neuropsychological phenomena beyond clinical psychology to include interdisciplinary
interest from other aspects of psychology (i.e., cognitive, school, forensic, developmental, clinical rehabilitation, physiological psychology). Within the
field of clinical psychology/clinical neuropsychology, a specialty of behavioral
neuropsychology has emerged. Horton (1979) defines behavioral neuropsychology as follows:
Essentially, behavioral neuropsychology may be defined as the application of behavior therapy techniques to problems of organically impaired individuals while
using a neuropsychological assessment and intervention perspective. This treatment philosophy assumes that inclusion of data from neuropsychological assessment strategies would be helpful in the formulation of hypotheses regarding
antecedent conditions (external or internal) for observed phenomena of psychopathology. (p. 20)
Clinical neuropsychology requires specialized training in addition to that of
general clinical psychology or clinical health psychology. Many doctoral training programs offer neuropsychology tracks or concentrations that include
specialized coursework, practica, and research experiences. Clinical neuropsychologists focus on assessment and diagnosis; behavioral neuropsychologists
emphasize problems of management, retraining, and rehabilitation (Horton,
2005). Patients who suffer from strokes, degenerative diseases (e.g., Alzheimer’s
disease, Huntington’s chorea), traumatic brain injury, or neurological problems
secondary to other medical problems or treatment (e.g., chemotherapy) are typical clients of the clinical neuropsychologist. These specialists practice their profession in many settings: private practice, hospitals, rehabilitation centers,
nursing homes, and interdisciplinary outpatient clinics. Christopher Royer, PhD,
a neuropsychologist and Division Director of Psychology and Neuropsychology
at his facility, describes his work as a clinician, administrator, supervisor, and
professor in Box 2.3.

Reflecting on his favorite and most challenging aspects of his clinical practice, he shares the following thoughts.
The Fields of Clinical Psychology 41
There are two components that are truly rewarding in this specialty. First, it is a great
opportunity to use psychological and neuropsychological assessment techniques to understand the person with a wonderful breadth of data. I look forward to difficult diagnostic questions and using psychological instruments to help me tease out these
problems. Secondly, working with individuals who have medical conditions is highly
rewarding. There are so many areas to intervene, and patients learn new ways to cope,
manage their illnesses, and become empowered with using behavioral strategies rather
than more passive medical treatments.
The biggest challenges are never related to the patient, but always in the business
arena. That being said, working with patients who have potential bias, such as workers’
compensation claims and other litigation, offer the most difficult challenges.
What Does Dr. Royer Like the Least about His Area of Specialty?
There is a great deal of need to educate the professional and lay community about how
psychology interacts with the body and with medical practice. While I really enjoy this
process, it feels, at times, as if the community, particularly in this area of the country,
is less ready to accept a behavioral approach that is so weighted in terms of the physical
manifestations of illness.
A Day in the Life of Dr. Royer
My days are quite varied, which is part of my continued enjoyment of this career. In addition to my clinical work, I teach half time, and there are responsibilities that go with
that obligation which take up more or less of my time depending on the day or week.
Typically, my family wakes up around 6:30 A.M. We try to do as much the night before to
be ready for the next day so that the family can get those few extra minutes in the morning. Typically, I will try to review my personal e-mail in the morning, while holding my
clinical and school accounts until later in the day. After getting everyone fed, we take my
15-year-old son to school. On a day with reasonable weather, I will walk with my 11-
year-old daughter to school, and then on to work (about 1.9 miles). I am visually impaired and I do not drive, so on bad-weather days, my wife will do a lot of transporting.
My wife is a part-time visiting nurse, so my 5-year-old will go to preschool on those days.
Upon arriving at work, my first order of business is to review the mail and referrals
from the day before. As the director of the office, I have to ensure that business flows.
I take time to check work e-mail as well. Often in the morning, I will meet and interview a testing referral and then get them started with an intern for the actual testing.
I then see two therapy patients before lunch. About 85% of my patients have medical
issues, and often they are able to come in during the day, as unemployment is a big
part of medical problems. I use a variety of behavioral and motivational interviewing
techniques to help patients cope with their illness and life circumstances. At 11:30, I
eat a quick lunch and meet with the intern (doctoral student from Philadelphia College of Osteopathic Medicine; PCOM) to see how the testing is going and make any
mid-course corrections in the protocol. I then review my school e-mail and try to do
some callbacks. The afternoon tends to be a mix of therapy clients, pain evaluations,
disability evaluations, dictating time, callback time, or consultation time for the hospital. My office is located in a medical rehab and long-term acute care setting, and we
consult with inpatients on a daily basis. Depending on the day, the last hour is either
42 Introduction
given to dictation or calls. Two days per week, I meet with the intern for formal supervision, although a lot of that occurs during the week. One afternoon per week, I leave
a bit early to teach class. I teach graduate students from the PsyD Program in Clinical
Psychology program at PCOM. In Harrisburg, there is a distance learning site to accommodate students in central Pennsylvania.
Evenings are also variable, and sometimes unpredictable. When there is school work to
be done (reading papers, dissertations, etc.), that is the time. Otherwise, I try to keep as
much work as possible at work, as family time is extremely important to all of us. Dinner is together, and then homework gets done. We have a large room where we all congregate to talk, play games, go online, watch movies, and so on. At some point, e-mail
is attended to again. Growing older, sleep is a nice end to the day!
Dr. Royer Provides the Following Recommendations for Persons Interested
in Joining His Field
Working with the medical population is a fantastic niche to be in. The need is great and
there is quite a bit of unexplored territory in terms of identifying and validating effective assessment and treatment strategies. For those considering neuropsychology or
health psychology, I would only caution that these are really entire fields of knowledge
and require a large amount of training in order to become competent. Finding graduate
and postgraduate specialty tracks allows one to really immerse oneself in the field.
Specialties by Personal Characteristics
Sometimes clients seek to find clinical psychologists who specialize in assessment or treatment of mental health problems in persons from identified minority groups. Some persons from gay, lesbian, transsexual, or transgendered
communities, feminists, those who hold spirituality or a specific religion as
central to their identity, or persons with diverse cultural backgrounds may prefer to obtain psychological services from persons who identify themselves as
having expertise in their area. Specializing in clinical psychology for persons
with such characteristics is often accomplished in less formal ways than that of
other specialties in that there are few programs with separate training tracks for
specific populations. However, all training programs should emphasize cultural
awareness and respect for individual diversity, and the importance of culturally
minded knowledge, skills, and professional attitudes.
Psychologists who become experts in the assessment, diagnosis, or treatment of one or more minority groups likely do so by focusing their research
(dissertation or postdoctoral work), literature review, clinical skills training
(workshops, practica, internship, supervision), consultation, and clinical practice on working with such populations. There are Special Interest Groups in the
ABCT organization that recognize these important specialties: African Americans in Behavior Therapy; Asian American Issues in Behavior Therapy and Research; Hispanic Issues in Behavior Therapy; Masculinity and Mental Health;
Native American Issues in Behavior Therapy and Research; Spiritual and Religious Issues in Behavior Change; Study of Gay, Lesbian, Bisexual, and Transgendered Issues; and Women’s Issues in Behavior Therapy. Likewise, the
The Fields of Clinical Psychology 43
Society of Clinical Psychology (APA Division 12) has two pertinent sections
that bring professionals together to discuss, study, and further some of the topics discussed here: Section 4: Clinical Psychology of Women, and Section 6:
Clinical Psychology of Ethnic Minorities. Gayle Iwamasa, PhD is a seasoned
professional who has had tremendous impact on the field of clinical psychology
through her leadership in national organizations (ABCT, APA) and publications
on multicultural competence. Her career embraces clinical, academic, and professional activities, as described in Box 2.4.
Box 2.4 Highlights of a Contemporary Psychologist
Gayle Iwamasa, PhD
Dr. Iwamasa holds a master’s degree in psychology and a doctoral degree in
clinical psychology from Purdue University. Her predoctoral internship and
postdoctoral training took place at University of California—San Francisco,
School of Medicine, Department of Psychiatry. She interned in major rotations
in short-term inpatient services, psychiatric emergency services, short-term
cognitive behavioral therapy, and long-term psychodynamic therapy. She is an
associate professor at DePaul University in Indiana, and a licensed psychologist and health service provider in psychology in Indiana. She also maintains
a private practice conducting clinical assessments and psychotherapy. Dr. Iwamasa has held numerous leadership positions in national organizations, including the Association
for Behavioral and Cognitive Therapies, Asian American Psychological Association, and the
American Psychological Association, and has published and consulted widely on multicultural
competencies. Dr. Iwamasa highlights her most and least favorite aspects of her career.
What Does Dr. Iwamasa Like the Most about Her Area of Specialty?
I don’t do the same thing all the time. I teach undergraduate and graduate students,
conduct cognitive behavioral therapy, conduct psychological evaluations, supervise
master’s level therapists and doctoral students, conduct research in areas of my interest,
and do consulting within and outside of psychology.
What Does Dr. Iwamasa Like the Least about Her Area of Specialty?
Since I like to do a lot of things, being able to say no to projects that I’d like to do is difficult. What I like the least as a faculty member are the numerous meetings, as a therapist—too much paperwork!
Dr. Iwamasa Provides the Following Recommendations for Persons Interested in
Joining Her Field
Get as much training as you can while you are in school, as once you get out, you’ll realize just how much you don’t know and wish you did! Once your job and personal life
demands fill your day, you might not have the time and money necessary to pursue as
much education and training as you’d like.
44 Introduction
Dr Iwamasa recommends two journals of primary interest to her: Cognitive and Behavioral Practice, and Cultural Diversity and Ethnic Minority Psychology. Dr. Iwamasa strives for
personal and professional balance, values her friendships and prioritizes her family. She
relies on e-mail to accomplish much of her leadership and professional work, and it also
allows her to stay connected with friends and colleagues nationally and internationally.
Specialties by Stage of Intervention
Viewing psychological and biopsychosocial problems along a continuum from
the trigger of a problem through its extinction splinters the discipline of clinical
psychology into additional subspecialties. Clinical psychologists’ practices may
be concentrated in the areas of prevention, crisis management, trauma response, acute- or long-term intervention, and rehabilitation. Sometimes the
focus on these areas of practice is dictated by practitioners’ employment setting
(e.g., psychiatric emergency center, partial hospitalization program, rehabilitation hospital). Clinical psychologists who are primarily researchers, scholars, or
academicians may select any of these stages of intervention for further study on
particular populations. Persons interested in pediatric clinical psychology
might investigate approaches to primary prevention of obesity. Or, clinical psychologists might focus on the immediate crisis of experiencing, or psychological
sequelae to surviving natural disasters such as Hurricane Katrina in New Orleans, Louisiana.
Prevention
Primary prevention generally refers to interventions or attempts to reduce the
probability that a mental or physical health problem will develop. Clinical
health psychologists who teach stress management and coping skills workshops
to employees of a large corporation may help prevent the development of anxiety or depressive disorders and subsequent time lost from absenteeism. Likewise, counseling children of impending divorcees may moderate potential
negative effects from parental separation.
Secondary prevention focuses on the early identification and treatment of
an existing disease (Llewelyn & Kennedy, 2003) or mental health disorder. Recognizing a child’s weaknesses in the classroom and timely diagnosis of attention
deficit disorder may increase the likelihood that the child will receive necessary
services to compensate or deal with those problems. Clinical psychologists aim
to help clients minimize negative intrapersonal, social, and occupational consequences resulting from psychological stressors or disorders.
Crisis Management and Intervention
Crisis management and intervention may be necessary at the individual, familial, societal, or even national level. On a personal or family level, clients might
experience a crisis caused by a sudden death or suicide in one’s family; one’s
own self-mutilating behavior or drug overdose and presentation to an emergency room; or domestic violence, rape, sexual harassment, or natural disaster
(e.g., fire or flood). Some of these events lead clients to appear in acute care
settings, whereas others are recipients of outreach efforts by mental health pro-
The Fields of Clinical Psychology 45
fessionals. Societal or national crises might include terrorism, hate crimes,
bombing, open firearms in schools, or other similar events. Clinical psychologists who have specialized training in crisis management and trauma intervention would be called to action for these clients. The intervention or support
given within the immediate time following the event is likely to differ greatly
from therapy rendered months after the occurrence. Clinical psychologists with
specialty in crisis and trauma intervention know when and how to intervene.
The Association for Behavioral and Cognitive Therapies has Special Interest
Groups (SIGs) that focus on crisis and trauma topics: Disaster and Trauma, and
Child Maltreatment and Family Violence. The Society of Clinical Psychology
(APA, Div.12) also has a section (7) for professionals interested in furthering
knowledge, training, and clinical services for “Clinical Emergencies and Crises.”
Dr. Patricia Resick, a clinical psychologist, is renowned for her work in trauma
and crisis response. An innovator and pioneer in this area, Dr. Resick is a past
president of ABCT (2003 to 2004) among many other impressive accomplishments. She shares a sample of her workday and her perspectives on this area of
research and practice in Box 2.5.
Box 2.5 Highlights of a Contemporary Psychologist
Patricia Resick, PhD
Dr. Resick, a Missouri licensed psychologist, obtained her doctoral degree at
the University of Georgia. Her predoctoral internship training took place
at the Middlesex Hospital Medical School in London, and at the VA in
Charleston, South Carolina. Since her specialty in trauma response did not
exist, her early experiences in the field came through volunteer work as one of
the first rape crisis counselors in the United States. In this position, she was
“on call” and went to the emergency room if a rape victim was brought to the
hospital. Postdoctoral fellowships were not required at the time her degree
was granted, so she took her first position as an assistant professor at the University of South Dakota. Dr. Resick shares her experiences and insights about her career working
in trauma response.
Dr. Resick is an active member in the American Psychological Association, the Association for Behavioral and Cognitive Therapies, and the International Society for Traumatic Stress Studies. Her
journals of choice include Journal of Clinical and Consulting Psychology, Journal of Applied Psychology, Behavior Therapy, Cognitive and Behavior Therapy, Journal of Traumatic Stress, and Psychology of Women Quarterly.
What Does Dr. Resick Like the Most and the Least about Her Area of Specialty?
I have never been bored by my area of specialty. When I began, nothing was known
about the effects of trauma on symptoms and functioning, natural recovery or how to
treat these symptoms. Over the past 3 decades, we have learned a great deal, but there
is still much to be learned. I find the topic endlessly fascinating and believe that the
topic is important.
46 Introduction
Regarding my job position, I love the people I work with. They are smart, hardworking,
full of ideas, and dedicated to quality research and clinical work. In my current position
at the National Center for PTSD, I have the potential to have an impact on improving
the quality of care given to those who have served our country and been harmed by
this service, veterans with Posttraumatic Stress Disorder.
What I like the least is that the VA is a very large health care system and a very large
bureaucracy. There are, what feels at times, unnecessary restrictions, rules, and repeated trainings. Sometimes it seems like I fill out so many productivity reports that it
actually interferes with my productivity.
What Does Dr. Resick Find to Be Her Biggest Challenges in Her Specialty or Position?
Our biggest challenge is to continue producing quality research and excellent care
when resources are becoming stretched under current national circumstances.

istrative duties. E-mail saves us from having as many meetings, but I read and respond
to about 150 e-mails a day.
Dr. Resick Provides the Following Recommendations for Persons Interested
in Joining Her Field
Before deciding, get some volunteer experience with traumatized populations such as
at a rape crisis center, domestic violence program, or victim assistance agency. Make
sure that you can handle hearing about traumatic events without being overwhelmed
by the stories. If you think you might be interested in research, do the same—get some
experience at your university, or at another research program.
At the national level, the American Psychological Association organized
the Disaster Response Network (DRN) through local and regional psychological
associations in 1992 to provide a mechanism through which psychologists can
volunteer to respond to local and national disasters and other traumatic events.
Through this organization, psychologists came together to aid Americans in
coping with the Oklahoma City bombing, Hurricanes Andrew and Katrina,
9/11, and other events. This volunteer network provides pro bono services to
communities affected by trauma, crisis, and disaster, and provides access to disaster mental health training for its members. The DRN collaborates with other
organizations that serve the same purpose of providing support during these
events. Its primary function is to participate in joint activities with the American Red Cross (APA, 2006).
Acute or Long-Term Intervention
Some may argue that acute and long-term intervention describes the bulk of
what most clinical practitioners do, so therefore, they may not constitute specialties within the field. However, those who practice in emergency room settings, psychiatric hospitals, or partial programs would argue that the skills used
in these settings differ from those used in others. In acute psychiatric settings,
psychologists’ practices might emphasize diagnostic skills, assessment and referral practices, and crisis intervention. Clinicians must write reports quickly
and efficiently, and be skilled at working with a wide variety of clients and
other health care professionals. Clients who use acute psychiatric services are
diverse in mental health status, psychological problems, and other personal
characteristics.
Long-term interventions could pertain to the practice of psychodynamically oriented psychotherapy, treatment of severely mentally ill or developmentally disabled individuals, or interventions geared toward persons with
personality disorders, multiple clinical diagnoses, or pervasive difficulties.
Given the movement in health care toward brief psychotherapy, a specialty in
long-term interventions is least likely to classify many psychologists today. It is
more likely that practice in a particular setting (e.g., psychiatric hospital) or
with a particular population (e.g., schizophrenic patients) would dictate who
uses long-term treatment interventions most often.
48 Introduction
Rehabilitation
Rehabilitation psychology is operationally defined this way by Division 22:
[T]he study and application of psychosocial principles on behalf of persons who
have physical, sensory, cognitive, developmental or emotional disabilities. . . . Rehabilitation psychologists work to foster personal and social growth of individuals
with disabilities using a perspective that emphasizes the whole person and optimal
use of assets. Rehabilitation psychologists pursue goals of improving rehabilitation
practices and changing environments to broaden opportunities available to persons with disabilities in social relationships, employment, education, community
and leisure activities. (Scherer et al., n.d.)
Psychologists specializing in rehabilitation psychology with training in
clinical psychology may work with spinal-cord injured patients, persons
with Lou Gehrig’s disease (amyotrophic lateral sclerosis), traumatic brain
injuries, or developmental disabilities, as examples. Their practice may be in
medical settings, academic institutions, political positions, administration,
or community services. Careers in rehabilitation psychology can take the
form of clinical practice, research, teaching, or administration. Again, many
specialties of clinical psychology overlap in the populations addressed,
services provided, or settings involved. For example, similarities between
clinical health psychology and rehabilitation psychology are evident,
although there are some distinct differences between these two fields in
their missions.
Division 22 of APA is dedicated to rehabilitation psychology. The purpose of this division is to “bring together all APA members interested in the
psychological aspects of disability and rehabilitation, to educate the public
on issues related to disability and rehabilitation, and to develop high standards and practices for professional psychologists who work in this field”
(APA, n.d.-c). In working toward this mission, clinical psychologists join colleagues from public policy psychology, developmental psychology, health
psychology, community psychology, physiological psychology, and other
fields. It is possible and likely that neuropsychologists and clinical health
psychologists practice within the field of rehabilitation psychology.
Specialties by Therapeutic Modality
In most doctoral training programs in psychology, students are taught about
psychopathology and well-being, and about individual assessment and treatment of children and adults. Assessment is a core component of clinical psychology that differentiates the abilities of psychologists from other mental
health professionals. Some psychologists do evaluations and assessments as the
staple practice of their profession. Assessments are critical to all treatment
planning, but are often required for forensic purposes, educational assistance
programs, supplemental insurance evaluations, disability determinations, and
differential diagnosis, to name a few. Not all clinical psychologists maintain
competency in objective and projective testing, and therefore, they, too, rely on
colleagues with this expertise.
The Fields of Clinical Psychology 49
Doctoral-level elective courses in graduate programs often are available in
group, family, or couples therapy although few doctoral programs in clinical
psychology directly offer extensive specialty training in these treatment modalities. Psychologists establish their expertise in providing group, family, or couples therapy through some didactic training, but largely develop their skills
through supervised clinical experience. Typically, psychologists who deliver
treatment in groups, family, or couples therapy do so for specific populations in
which they specialize: medically ill, relationship satisfaction, depressed individuals, and others.
Specialties by Settings
Graduate training is usually general in that it prepares graduates to practice
psychology in a variety of settings for diverse populations. As many psychologists’ careers develop, their competencies are likely to expand within their
specialty area, and fade in others. Psychologists who practice in outpatient
community mental health might have completely different philosophies
about note-taking, client retention, and treatment planning than academic
psychologists who typically treat volunteer clients as part of their research
programs. A greater contrast might be found by comparing clinical psychologists who are employed in hospital settings with those who work in the forensic arena. These two groups of psychologists tend to have different knowledge
bases, competencies, and practices. Thus, psychologists are likely to follow
professional literature and conferences that pertain to their daily activities
and are less likely to maintain awareness of distal practices. The following is a
list of common settings in which clinical psychologists work: inpatient mental
health facilities, outpatient private or community mental health practices, inpatient/outpatient medical settings (hospitals, physician or holistic health care
practices), corporate settings, educational/academic settings, forensic settings,
research settings, or political settings. The roles and functions of clinical psychologists in these settings differ extensively. Yet, science, theory, and practice
are common themes in all subspecialties of clinical psychology and can be applied or explored in any of these settings.
Forensic Psychology
Clinical forensic psychologists dedicate their career to focusing on the interface
between law and psychology, and the application of theory, principles, and research from both disciplines. Forensic psychologists work within prison systems, in private practices, academic settings, legal settings, or government.
Educating the public and both professions about law and psychology is also a
critical role for these specialists.
Assessment is often a core component of forensic psychology practices.
Forensic psychologists may conduct assessments to evaluate child or senioradult custody cases, to determine competency to stand trial or be one’s own
guardian, or to assess fitness for duty. Within the court system, these psychologists are involved in jury selection and providing expert testimony. The Federal
50 Introduction
Bureau of Investigation (FBI) also seeks clinical forensic psychologists in profiling criminals, and carrying out governmental work requiring expertise in
clinical psychology. Applied forensic intervention practice might involve
psychotherapy for persons remanded to treatment by the courts, such as sex offenders or professionals with addictive disorders. In addition, forensic psychologists often become involved in helping with state and national legislation of
licensure and other field-related policies.
Like other specialties in clinical psychology, forensic psychologists hold
academic appointments and conduct research on topics interfacing psychology
and the law. Psychologists with expertise in forensic psychology often teach
ethics courses and specialty topics regarding decision making, law, and clinical
populations. Training in forensic psychology is achieved either through specialty track training in a clinical psychology doctoral program, or by acquiring
a doctorate in clinical psychology and a separate law degree. Some training
programs offer joint degrees in law (JD) and psychology (PhD or PsyD). The
APA Division 41 is the American Psychology-Law Society, and is dedicated to
the “understanding of law and legal institutions, the education of psychologists in legal matters and law personnel in psychological matters, and the application of psychology in the legal system” (APA, n.d.-a). Dr. Samuel Knapp
maintains a unique position in the field of forensic psychology, but the impact
of his work reaches across all practice areas of psychology. Highlights of his
daily practice are exhibited in Box 2.6.
Box 2.6 Highlights of a Contemporary Psychologist
Samuel Knapp, PhD
Dr. Knapp holds a master’s degree in psychology from Indiana University of
Pennsylvania (1976), and a doctorate from Lehigh University (1982). His
predoctoral internship training was at the Lehigh University Counseling
Center. Dr. Knapp’s practice of forensic psychology is unique in that he works
for the Pennsylvania State Board of Psychology.
Dr. Knapp is a member of numerous organizations: American Psychological
Association—Fellow; Division 29 (Psychotherapy); Division 31 (State,
Provincial, Territorial Psychological Associations); Division 36 (Religion and
Psychology); Asian American Psychological Association; Pennsylvania Psychological Association (PPA); and Society for Ethics Across the Curriculum.
He attends annual conventions of the American Psychological Association and the Pennsylvania
Psychological Association, and subscribes to numerous professional publications to stay abreast of
the literature: Professional Psychology: Research and Practice; Ethics and Behavior; International Journal of Religion and Psychology; Ethics and Across the Curriculum; Scientific American: Mind; and Psychotherapy: Theory, Research, Practice, Training. Dr.
Knapp strives for balance in his life by walking his dogs, enjoying relaxing activities with his wife
and his adult children, or reading science fiction.
Here he shares some of his favorite aspects of his job, as well as its greatest challenges.
The Fields of Clinical Psychology 51
What Does Dr. Knapp Like the Most about His Area of Specialty?
The job responsibilities that I like most include direct consultation with members on
legal and ethical issues, writing articles, and working with specific committees.
Consultation/Education/Committee Work
Some of the programs developed by the State Board of Psychology include the creation of an article bank of common professional and ethical problems encountered by
our members that are placed on the PPA web site. We have also published a book,
Pennsylvania Law and Psychology (now in its fourth edition) that graduate programs
often use.
We have a comprehensive program of continuing education, especially in the areas of
ethics and professional issues. These include small-group collaborative learning programs, small group interactive programs in specialties (such as psychologists working
in child custody areas, in college counseling centers, with religious professionals, in
prisons or correctional facilities), and a small group decision-making program where
we have collected pre- and posttest data on the respondents and are currently analyzing the data to determine if the CE program led to an actual improvement in ethical
decision-making ability. In addition to their didactic value, these small group workshops help psychologists get to know other psychologists and help create a sense of
community.
With assistance of the PPA Ethics Committee, we have created a series of home studies
on ethics that is designed to cover the range of common ethical issues encountered by
psychologists. In my role, I also consult with PPA members by helping to problem-solve
and answering over 2,000 e-mails and 1,000 phone calls annually regarding ethical
questions or dilemmas.
The perspective we take in ethics education is “positive ethics,” whereby we try to use
ethics to help psychologists reach their highest level of performance, as opposed to
merely avoiding disciplinary sanctions. I am fortunate to have a “gaggle” of colleagues
who share this perspective and who write and teach with this orientation.
Articles
I also write articles for the Pennsylvania Psychologist. I try to make these articles down to
earth and relevant for practicing psychologists. On my own time, I write articles for
professional publications (I have about 100 peer-reviewed articles so far). Sometimes I
adapt materials from my personal writing for publication in the Pennsylvania Psychologist
and vice versa.
What Does Dr. Knapp Find to Be His Biggest Challenges in His Specialty or Position?
The biggest challenge is dealing with insurance and managed care companies. The patient protection laws are weak and there are many loopholes by which patients are
denied the benefits they were promised in their contracts. I spend a lot of time with
members (and also government agencies and insurers) on insurance and reimbursement issues.
52 Introduction
Summary: Making the Right Choices for You
Clinical psychology, a specialty within the overarching field of psychology, also
has many subspecialties. Clinical psychologies have a common interest in the
integration of science, theory, and practice with the mission of advancing the
field for the betterment of the profession and society. A key facet to all specialties within clinical psychology is the constant interchange of ideas between
clinical science and the application of that science. Thus, scientist-practitioners,
practitioner-scholars, educators, administrators, and all others who hold true to
clinical psychology need to stay abreast of current literature, movements in the
field, government and politics related to the specialty areas, and feedback from
clients who use clinical psychology services and information.
In this chapter, the practices of clinical psychologists have been magnified
to illustrate how specialized the subfields of clinical psychology have become.
With so many choices, and so many overlapping missions and purposes, how
do you make sense of it all? How do you choose a career path? If you are a doctoral student, you may soon be asked to name your dissertation topic, which
will associate you with a particular expertise. In master’s training, your clinical
experiences and supervision during graduate school may dictate what jobs you
can acquire when you complete your degree. Which way should you go?
Which way should you turn on this winding and expansive road of clinical psychology? This summary can help you understand your options among the
many subdisciplines described in this chapter.
First, by selecting your graduate training program, it is likely that you have
chosen or will soon focus on a particular theoretical orientation from which you
will learn to conceptualize clients, hypothesize about research questions, or interpret the thoughts and behaviors of persons you encounter. You have already
begun to define your expertise in clinical psychology. As you progress through
your training, many of your courses will delve into life span issues, psychopathology, ethics, cultural and individual diversity, research, and perhaps assessment
and intervention. Which courses have excited you the most or you are most
looking forward to? As you work through each course, use paper assignments as
opportunities to learn about patient populations or practice settings that you
may not be discussing at length in class. Or, if you are already a practitioner,
think about the clients who have interested you the most or piqued your curiosity. What do you find yourself wanting to learn more about? This is where the
specialties begin to develop.
For some, psychopathology in the form of severe mental illness or Axis II
personalities is most fascinating. For others, no one patient population stands
out—the diversity of mental health issues, perhaps among the general community, is most intriguing. One psychologist-in-training gears practicum and internship choices toward working exclusively with schizophrenic patients and
creates a dissertation on a particular nuance of treatment for these individuals.
For another trainee, the medical setting and working with physically ill individuals might seem to be her true calling. This individual might seek diversified
training opportunities to prepare to work with a variety of patient populations
in hospitals, outpatient, or primary care settings.
The Fields of Clinical Psychology 53
Thus far on this journey, perhaps you have selected a patient population
or setting for practice. Within these choices lie many more. Do you have the
stamina to make a difference in a crisis situation, to help minimize the impact
of a traumatic event? Do you excel in establishing long-standing personal relationships that could aid in complicated long-term treatment of persons who
may not otherwise trust people they encounter? Where do you think you are
likely to make a difference?
Many psychologists develop expertise around particular techniques and
skills, such as stress management and relaxation training, meditation practices,
self-control strategies, cognitive restructuring, or contingency management.
The skills you develop may also dictate the career you create for yourself. Some
techniques and skill sets are geared more toward a specific setting than toward
others, or toward particular patient populations rather than others. This is yet
another aspect of training to consider.
As you reflect on this chapter, you may recognize that there are many
ways to select your specialty areas within clinical psychology, if you choose to
specialize at all. To come up with a plan for your future career, you may want
to consider which modality (individual, couples, family, groups) of treatment
you most enjoy. Is there a particular population (e.g., children, adults, senior
adults, medical patients, underserved immigrants) to which you hope to dedicate your work? Are there certain human pathologies that you would most
like to learn more about? Finally, in what setting do you believe you are most
likely to thrive? You will find the answers to these questions in bits and pieces
of your experiences along the way as you continue your training journey. If
you attend to these guideposts along the way, you will find your direction. Remember that the answers are not mutually exclusive, nor are the careers in
the subspecialties. Many paths run parallel or concurrent. Many psychologists
have fulfilling careers by retaining generalist practitioner skills in assessment
and intervention for the service of diagnostically and individually diverse
clients. Clinical psychologists commonly hold teaching, administrative, clinical, and research positions in one stage of their career. The beauty of a career
in clinical psychology is that your choices are almost endless!




We live in a society that comprises many cultural elements, yet our clinical assumptions are often based on information from limited subgroups or limited contexts. What we know about human behavior frequently
lacks a broad cultural framework. To be effective with an increasingly diverse
population, our clinical interventions need to be grounded in cultural dynamics. This begins with sensitivity to culture as a primary psychological and social
variable. By increasing our consciousness and studying the workings of culture,
we can open the door to deeper understanding and more effective interventions in our pluralistic society.

56 Introduction
Cultural Competence as Fundamental Practice
In the revisions of the APA Ethics Code for psychologists published in 2002, the
notion of competence in understanding and working with cultural differences
in both clinical and research settings went from aspiration to a specifically detailed standard for expected professional conduct (APA, 2002, 2.01 [b]). This
standard recognizes that an understanding of factors associated with age, gender, gender identity, race, ethnicity, culture, national origin, religion, sexual
orientation, disability, language, or socioeconomic status may be essential for
effective implementation of service or research. Other ethical principles emphasize that respect for others’ rights and dignity (APA, 2002, Principle E), jusClinical Example: Doris (Vignette 1)
Doris is a 45-year-old African American woman who is married, has two
children, and holds an administrative
position in a large academic institution.
Despite a demanding schedule, her
lifestyle is sedentary, and she is not involved in any systematic form of exercise. Although her employer has a
sophisticated employee wellness program that includes various opportunities for health improvements and even
financial incentives for wellness efforts,
she does not take advantage of these
options. In fact, Doris seems to avoid
attending to her health. She went for a
medical checkup a few years ago only
because persistent headaches were interfering with her work. In this evaluation, it was discovered that she had
hypertension (high blood pressure) and
Type II (adult onset) diabetes.
Her physician prescribed antihypertensive medication and dietary management of the diabetes. The doctor noted
several important health risks in addition to her lack of exercise: a high fat
diet; smoking; a family history of hypertension and heart disease; and a body
mass index (BMI—a measure of her
overall body weight in proportion to
her height) greater than 30, classifying
her as obese. He encouraged her to stop
smoking and lose weight, and insisted
that she have a follow-up consultation
with a diabetes management clinic.
Doris initially complied with taking
the antihypertensive medication, but she
was inconsistent in adhering to the medication regimen. She also complied with
the recommendation for the diabetes
clinic consult. During her first visit, she
talked briefly with a diabetes health care
team that included a physician, a nurse
practitioner, a nutritionist, a social
worker, and a psychologist. They encouraged her to begin regular exercise, to develop a plan for smoking cessation, to
modify her diet according to the guidelines offered by the nutritionist, and to
return for regular follow-up visits at the
diabetes clinic to monitor her progress.
Doris appreciated their kindly manner,
but did not follow through on any of
their suggestions, and did not keep any
follow-up appointments.
Can you suggest why Doris made the
two office visits but did not engage in
the recommended behavioral changes
or follow-up visits? Do you think that
any aspect of culture might have played
a role in this outcome? We discuss
Doris periodically throughout the chapter to illustrate the interaction between
culture, clinical and behavioral problems, and the methods and strategies of
intervention.

tice and equality of service to all persons (Principle D), and the safeguarding of
the rights and welfare of those directly and indirectly affected by our work
(Principle A) are essential aspirations for all professional decisions and judgments in the field of psychology.
Understanding cultural context should not be marginalized as an optional
or special interest pursuit, but instead valued as a basic component of professional competence. Cultural context is important in clinical work because cultural variables affect the validity of assessment and diagnosis, the applicability
of research results, the quality of a therapeutic alliance, the development of a
treatment plan, and the overall effectiveness of treatment delivered. Traditional
psychological services are often inadequate for members of ethnic minority
groups, particularly in terms of cultural and linguistic fit (S. Sue, 1998). At the
same time, we have a growing multiethnic population in the United States
(Aponte & Crouch, 2000; U.S. Census Bureau, 2001).
The notion of cultural competence incorporates knowledge, skills, and attitudes. S. Sue (1998) defines cultural competence as “the belief that people
should not only appreciate and recognize other cultural groups, but be able to
effectively work with them” (p. 440). In this chapter, we cover population
trends, terminology, and cultural processes to help you recognize differences,
and summarize some key strategies for working effectively with cultural variables in a clinical setting.
The Diverse People of the United States
The people of the United States are becoming an increasingly varied population
in terms of ethnic and cultural heritage (see Figure 3.1). Demographic trends
based on the population composition as of the 2000 U.S. Census predict that by
the middle of this century (2050), the Caucasian majority will shrink to 50%,
with other racial/ethnic groups comprising the remaining 50% in varying degrees. Currently, approximately 67% of the U.S. population is identified as
White. Although categories overlap to some extent as individuals may report

Asian/Pacific
Hispanic

58 Introduction
more than one racial affiliation, the breakdown of the remaining 33% is as follows: 13% African American, 13% Hispanic, 4.5% Asian/Pacific Islander,
1.5% American Indian or Alaskan Native, and 7% of some other race (APA,
2003; U.S. Census Bureau, 2001). There also appears to be an increasing
birthrate of biracial individuals, as 42% of those who endorsed more than one
race in the 2000 census were under the age of 18.
Historically, the United States has been a country with a significant White
majority, with African Americans comprising the largest minority, and other
racial/ethnic groups having much smaller presence. Now, there is greater diversity, and in the future we can expect even more heterogeneity among the people. Beyond increasing racial and ethnic variance, we also expect more age
variance, as longevity increases. Now, approximately 12% of the population is
age 65 or older, but that is expected to grow to 21% by mid-century. There will
also be a corresponding increase in the oldest ages, with those 85 and beyond
comprising 5% of the population, compared with 1.5% as of the year 2000
(Armas, 2004, as cited in “Whites’ Majority Steadily Shrinking,” 2004).
Clinical science and practice has significant challenges ahead in understanding and relating to diverse clinical populations and appreciating the possible social and personal implications of these broad cultural shifts. We can
reasonably anticipate that tensions, challenges, and opportunities will be embedded in this increasingly heterogeneous society. The environment as we now
know it will be significantly changed, although we cannot fully predict the impact of those changes. Clinicians now entering the field, including those who
will complete their training in the years between 2010 and 2020, will be the
providers working with this changing population over the bulk of their career
as we progress toward the predicted patterns of 2050. Major population trends
to anticipate are summarized in Table 3.1.
As the population changes, we may also see corresponding shifts in the
clinical problems that precipitate a referral to psychological treatment. This
may be particularly true for problems that disproportionately affect certain
groups. There are many potential examples of problems associated with population groups such as persons who are elderly, disabled, homeless, and gay/lesbian. Whether these problems are adequately conceptualized and treated
depends in part on the social impact of these concerns and the visible advocacy
on behalf of the minority group affected. Culturally sensitive research can help
us to pinpoint relevant factors that influence the onset, maintenance, or outTable 3.1 Major Demographic Trends Expected between 2010

come of pressing clinical and behavioral problems, and thus increase the effectiveness of our interventions.
Common Terminology
Defining terms and concepts is important in establishing a systematic approach for
training, research, and development of a common understanding (see Table 3.2).
As outlined in the APA Multicultural Guidelines (2003), the terms of culture,
race, ethnicity, multiculturalism, and diversity should be delineated for clear and
consistent use. Diversity is the most encompassing term, referring to the multiple
aspects of a person’s social identity—race, ethnicity, language, sexual orientation,
gender, age, disability, economic status, education, religious/spiritual affiliation,
and other social roles. When we describe these aspects of a person’s social identity, we are describing the individual’s social diversity. The term multiculturalism is
often used interchangeably with diversity to refer to the dimensions relevant to
identity. In the APA Guidelines, however, the term is used precisely and refers to
interactions between racial or ethnic groups in the United States. In this chapter,
we follow this distinction and discuss the diverse aspects of individual clients and
encourage multicultural experiences as a means of increasing cultural competence.
Although the term race is formally defined as a genealogical line (American
Heritage, 1994), psychological observers have noted that biological racial categories and phenotypic characteristics have more within-group variation than

between-group variation, and that a consensual definition of race does not
exist (Helms & Cook, 1999). A definition of race within the field of psychology
is a socially constructed category to which individuals are assigned on the basis
of physical characteristics such as skin color (APA, 2003). Similarly, ethnicity
does not have a consensus definition. APA Guidelines refer to ethnicity as “the
acceptance of the group mores and practices of one’s culture of origin and the
concomitant sense of belonging,” (p. 380). The Guidelines also note that individuals with multiple ethnic identities may operate with different salience
at different times. Similarly, the American Heritage Dictionary (1994) defines
“ethnic” as a group heritage of common and distinctive racial, national, religious, linguistic, or cultural features. Of note in this context is the common
term ethnocentricism, which is the belief in the superiority of one’s own ethnic or
other culturally based group compared with other ethnic or other culturally
based groups.
Finally, culture is defined as the belief systems and value orientations that
influence customs, norms, practices, psychological processes, organizations,
and social institutions (APA, 2003, p. 380). Culture includes a way of living and
viewing the rest of the world that is influenced and shaped by historical, economic, ecological, and political forces. As Triandis (1995) aptly states, “Culture
is to society what memory is to the person” (p. 341). It specifies ways to think
about self and social behavior that produce functional designs for living. As
Kaschak (1992) points out, culture includes the rules for perception and organization of experiences, both interpersonal, and intrapersonal. Thus, the
meaning of any experience or practice is embedded within the context of culture. Cultural socialization helps to determine the salience of experiences related to the private self (thoughts related to traits, states, or actions of oneself,
or what “I” see); the public self (thoughts related to the view of oneself from a
generalized other or what “they” see of me); or the collective self (thoughts
about what a group of specific others think, such as what “the family” or “my
colleagues” think of me). Persons raised in the culture of East Asia, for example, will pay more attention and think more often of their collective self than
people with a European or North American background (Triandis, 1995).
Although there are many variables within a culture, all individuals have a
cultural heritage, and an ongoing cultural identity. A person who has contact
with another culture may experience psychological acculturation, or the internal
modification of beliefs, values, and other aspects of behavior as a result of this
interaction. This modification is typically an uneven process where beliefs or
values and behaviors do not shift in a uniform manner, but rather through a series of interactions, highly influenced by acculturation attitudes and strategies
(Berry, 1995). Both self and culture are dynamic, ever-changing across time
and different environments, moving toward complexity when acculturation is
effective, and shifting back toward simplification when complexity becomes
very high or unworkable (Triandis, 1995).
An appreciation of diversity will help us better understand individual differences, both within and between groups. Culture is a mechanism that shapes
individual and group identity by systematizing the beliefs and values that organize and direct perceptions, thoughts, actions, and indeed the very definition of
self and reality for its constituents. Cultural belief systems, value orientation, and
Working with Cultural Diversity 61
common practices are, in turn, shaped by history, politics, economics, and the interaction of all these forces. As individuals are exposed to and become involved
with different groups, they will likely experience psychological acculturation,
where they develop some understanding and accept or adopt characteristics of
the new group, including the salience of a private, public, or collective self. Multicultural experiences thus contribute to the diverse aspects of anyone’s social
identity. To be effective as clinicians, educators, and scientists, we need to be familiar with these diverse aspects of identity (APA, 2000a). Both race and ethnicity are socially constructed ways of grouping large numbers of people. In reality,
most racial or ethnic categories incorporate many individual differences within
the group, so that we must use great caution in considering any cultural generalizations on this basis. It is relevant, however, to consider racial and ethnic identity in a context of cultural diversity (Table 3.2).
Attunement to Cultural Diversity in Clinical Context
Many current resources emphasize two primary perspectives on culture in the
context of clinical practice: knowledge of one’s own cultural heritage and varying social identities, and knowledge of other cultures (APA, 2003, p. 378; see
also Hansen, Pepitone-Arreola-Rockwell, & Greene, 2000; Hays, 2001). An understanding of yourself provides grounding in internal awareness of culture
and its influence on perceptions and values, as well as recognition of your stimulus value to others and the potential limitations or even biases in working
with differing cultures. Knowledge of other cultures can reduce limitations or
potential biases although this is a volitional process and will not happen automatically with a bit of information or slight exposure.
Ask yourself to think about at least one cultural institution and its practices that you believe had a significant impact on your childhood or adolescence. Maybe you will think about growing up in a military family and how
that affiliation affected your geographic mobility and your sense of patriotism
and service. Or you might think about your ethnic background and how your
family connected with various social activities and events associated with this
ethnicity. Maybe you continue to treasure and practice these traditions. Perhaps the educational system was a prominent aspect of your cultural development, and you spent long hours studying to achieve academic success. You
worried about your performance, but your excellent grades were highly rewarded, and your family made a major fuss over your graduation.
Do you think that your experiences with this particular cultural institution and its practices fostered your sense of belonging and self-esteem, or did
they lead you to question your place or value in the broader society? How did
these experiences shape the person that you know yourself to be today? Now
ask yourself to consider just how this particular experience might affect your
reactions to someone with a different personal history and different values. If
you are devoted to your extended family and your client shrugs off a family reunion as being “unimportant and too much trouble,” would you label that person as schizoid or interpersonally impaired? If you have a close involvement
62 Introduction
with a religious institution, do you tend to view others with casual religious
practices as having poorly formed character? How might your own experiences
affect the way that you filter or interpret someone else’s “story” that is either
similar or different from your own?
Our attunement to cultural diversity begins with the recognition that all
people are multicultural, all interactions are cross-cultural, and all experience is
perceived from a cultural perspective (APA, 2003). In the clinical setting, the
patient’s culture can influence the development and maintenance of the presenting problem, how the therapist perceives the problem, how the patient
copes, assets and barriers that will influence treatment, and the degree of collaboration and rapport. To further understand how culture affects our judgments
and interpersonal interactions, let’s take a closer look at the psychological and
social processes that are relevant to cultural dynamics.
Cognitive and Social Processes
A basic psychological process in how we organize information about our world
and experience is by reducing information into manageable chunks. The application of this cognitive process to social interactions was originally conceptualized by Allport (1954) in his social categorization theory. To make sense out of
a highly complex and dynamic social world, people use the normal process of
information chunking to create categories into which they can sort people.
Then they associate various characteristics, preferences, and tendencies with
particular categories and groups. Categorization appears to be an automatic,
largely nonvolitional process that serves several useful purposes, including fast
and efficient use of cognitive resources (Fiske, 1998), and a means by which we
locate and define ourselves within a complex social landscape (J. Turner,
1987). However, the advantages of speed and orientation are often offset by
significant issues of accuracy and notable resistance to change.
Easily noticeable characteristics, especially those that are visible or physical features of the person quickly create summary impressions. The summary
impression is then perceived as predominant or prototypic aspects of the category, forming a stereotype (Wade & Tavris, 2000; Worchel, 1999). This stereotype will persist, even when disconfirming information is available (Kunda &
Thagard, 1996). Behavior is then interpreted and judged through the filter of
the stereotype, further reinforcing the cognitive aspects of the existing category,
particularly when there is some motivation to confirm the stereotype (Kunda &
Sinclair, 1999). Arbitrary inferences may occur, especially concerning motivations of the categorized person, even if these inferences are inaccurate for one,
some, or most people or situations.
Stereotyping effects typically refer to judging an individual on the basis of
an expectation for the group or category, such that the person is assimilated
into category membership (Biernat, 2003). Exceptionally tall people are frequently assumed to have both skill and passion for playing the game of basketball. If you attend a national basketball tournament or a professional game,
where the players indeed do have skill and passion, you will also likely notice
the remarkable height among this group. A survey of tall high school seniors
would probably yield a wide range of interest, motivation, and skill concerning
Working with Cultural Diversity 63
basketball. Yet most of those tall seniors would probably be familiar with the
basketball stereotype, having been routinely asked about their interest or involvement in the sport.
Biernat (2003) further explores how stereotypes affect judgments in other
ways, including shifting subjective standards when behavior contrasts with
stereotyped expectations. Staying with our basketball example, this shift based
on category stereotypes would occur when a relatively small player receives
surprised congratulations for scoring a three-point shot, because he is “pretty
good for a short guy.” The subjective judgment of “good” is shaped by the contrast with the stereotyped expectation that skillful basketball players are exceptionally tall. According to Biernat, these stereotypic effects have a potentially
significant impact on the standards to which stereotyped groups are held, the
evaluations they receive, and the behaviors that others display toward them.
Consider further how different cultural dimensions may interact in applying
stereotypes. Persons of color, especially African Americans, may be stereotyped
as superior at basketball. Women, however, are stereotyped as less athletic than
men. Thus, if one imagines a superior basketball player, chances are—based on
stereotypes—that an image of a tall, African American male would come to
mind. When considering potential interests or talents of a petite Asian woman,
stereotypes could affect our judgments to the extent that we might put basketball at the end of a long list of options, if we even considered it at all.
An important social aspect of the categorization process is the separating
of categories into in-groups and out-groups (Fiske, 1998; Hornsey & Hogg,
2000; Tajfel & Turner, 1986; J. Turner, Brown, & Tajfel, 1979). In identifying
with different social groups to create an internal social identity and corresponding sense of place and position in the world, we automatically sort social
groups into categories of “us” and “them.” This identification can happen easily and quickly, often on the basis of visible group membership characteristics
(Atkinson & Hackett, 1995; D. W. Sue & Sue, 1999) and as soon as it does, predictable biases become operative (Wade & Tavris, 2000). First, there is a tendency to give favor to our in-group over the out-group. Second, we tend to
exaggerate differences between groups and similarities within our group and
to magnify the consistency of those relationships (e.g., “we” are better and very
different from “them,” and we are consistently better, while they are consistently inferior; Fiske, 1998; Hewstone, Rubin, & Willis, 2002). Reactions to our
in-group versus an out-group consistently show greater trust, more cooperation, greater generosity, and higher value (Brewer & Brown, 1998; Hewstone
et al., 2002). The differences may not be as significant or consistent as we think
they are, but our reactions tend to be highly consistent with our judgments.
Strong in-group affiliation has been associated with a greater degree of
prejudice toward outsiders (Swim & Mallett, 2002), a serious concern when the
distribution of power and resources is considered (APA Guidelines, 2003). Ingroup affiliation is strengthened in competitive situations, but with notable psychological risks. Competition can make people feel insecure and anxious, even if
they are winning, and angry and frustrated if they lose. It can decrease work motivation, and promote jealousy and hostility toward rivals (Wade & Tavris, 2000).
In-group members of a majority group may legitimize discrimination toward
out-group members of a minority group on the basis of perceived differences
64 Introduction
that are often simply a function of the categorical split between the groups. Prejudice, a negative stereotype with strong associated affect, will likely increase
when people worry about their incomes and stability of their communities and
perceive themselves to be in direct competition with another group for economic
resources.
Implications, Risks, and Risk Management
Social categorization has profound implications, particularly in competitive situations. We know that categorization is a normal cognitive process and an aspect
of the important executive function of constructed judgment. As clinicians and
researchers, we learn critical thinking skills that emphasize the importance of
both confirming and disconfirming information when forming judgments about
individuals or groups. However, the human interactions brought into therapy by
our clients are not typically characterized by careful, critical thought processes.
Even having a conscious endorsement of egalitarian beliefs does not necessarily
mean that one is free from unconscious stereotypes about groups (Greenwald
& Banaji, 1995). Our challenge is to bring a deliberate thought process into the
clinical interaction so that we can more fully recognize the influences of social
categorization within the client’s struggles and attempts at solution.
We all have multiple social identities, some visible and others more private.
We all make judgments and inferences on the basis of categories of social identity,
especially the most visible ones. And we are all influenced by the in-group/outgroup categorization process. As noted by APA (2003, p. 385) “membership in
one group helps to shape perceptions not only of one’s own group but also of
other groups. The links between those perceptions and attitudes are loyalty to
and valuing of one’s own group and devaluing the other group.” Further, persons
of racial or ethnic minority background comprise an out-group for most psychologists (APA Guidelines, 2003). Issues of competition, particularly for vital resources, can trigger a hazardous situation of polarization based on group
membership, increasing the possibility of prejudice and discrimination.
A starting point for mitigating the risks of social categorization in clinical
situations is the clinician’s own commitment to control automatic biases. This is
possible by following professional recommendations to establish motivation, information, and appropriate mood (APA Guidelines, 2003; Fiske, 1998). “Colorblind” approaches that minimize or ignore group differences have been found to
be ineffective and may increase stereotypes or perpetuate intergroup inequalities (Brewer & Brown, 1998; Macrae & Bodenhausen, 2000; Wolsko, Park,
Judd, & Wittenbrink, 2000). Instead, “ongoing development of one’s personal
and cross-cultural awareness, knowledge, and skills is recommended,” (APA
Guidelines, 2003, p. 384). Awareness of attitudes and values is the first step, especially awareness of attitudes of preference for within-group similarity, and
negative perceptions of out-group members. Exposure to other groups is important if it includes empathy and recognition of the different perspectives (Finlay
& Stephan, 2000; Galinsky & Moskowitz, 2000; Pettigrew, 1998) and actively
increases tolerance and trust of racial and ethnic groups (J. Greenberg et al.,
1992; R. M. Kramer, 1999) while directly recategorizing “us versus them” to a
concept of “we” (Gaertner & Dovidio, 2000).
Working with Cultural Diversity 65
Greater knowledge of and contact with different cultural groups in a context of empathy, understanding, and valuing should also include appreciating
what it is like to be a member of a culturally stigmatized group (Crocker, Major,
& Steele, 1998; Major, Quinton, & McCoy, in press). External events such as
acts of prejudice and discrimination trigger internal emotional and cognitive
processing of these experiences, activating schema for value and social status.
These events might occur episodically, randomly, or predictably, and without
regard to whether they are recognized as discrimination by the target, or by observers such as a therapist.
Discrimination is real, yet it is seldom “as real” to those for whom it is an
infrequent or distant event. Members of stigmatized groups live with the
specter of stereotype threat, or the constant possibility that their behavior will
be found consistent with negative stereotypes, regardless of the accuracy of this
judgment. Further, the broader cultural hierarchy is an inescapable stress, in
the sense that individual members cannot change the position of their own stigmatized group, and they cannot deny that a social hierarchy exists.
Clinical Example: Doris (Vignette 2)
Doris has some notable health risks and
problems. Is it possible that in-group and
out-group dynamics affected Doris’ response to the health care professionals?
As a member of a minority group and
a person with only a high school education, Doris may have been intimidated
by the all-Caucasian, highly educated
and powerful medical team. As an
African American, Doris is a member of
a group that, for a variety of reasons, is
apprehensive about placing trust in the
health care system. The brief and directive recommendations of the team, although well-intentioned, implied a lack
of understanding or concern for Doris
and her particular frame of reference.
She knows many people in her community who smoke and have hypertension,
diabetes, and obesity, and thus she does
not grasp the urgency of her health
risks. It is easier to dismiss the medical
recommendations that come from
sources she does not necessarily trust,
especially when she has much anecdotal
evidence that people live with these
problems all around her and nothing bad
seems to be happening to them. Doris
might be more attuned to the perspective of her collective self (what her family and community think of her) than to
her private self (what she thinks and
feels) or to her public self (what “they”
think she should do), but the team appealed mainly to her private self.
The medical team, on the other hand,
may have assumed that Doris did not
care about her size or health and was
unwilling to change. They may have exaggerated her acceptance of her obesity
and diabetes based on a stereotype,
since both conditions are so prevalent in
her African American cohort (www.cdc
.gov). Given limited resources (their
time), they may have automatically decided to discharge her with a few quick
recommendations to preserve the resources for other patients who might accept guidance more readily.
How could the team have been more
effective? We return to the discussion
of Doris in subsequent sections on effective strategies for practice.
66 Introduction
Individuals in a Cultural Context
Some theoretical models of identity development specific to racial and ethnic
minority groups have emphasized conceptualization of stages of cultural integration (see Atkinson, Morten, & Sue, 1998; Berry & Sam, 1997; Helms, 1990;
Parham, 2001; Ruiz, 1990). In contrast to members of a majority group whose
positive identification with their culture may develop automatically, members
of racial and ethnic minority groups have a more challenging psychological acculturation. They may initially value other groups (the dominant culture) and
devalue their own culture. In further development, they may move to valuing
their own group and separating from the dominant culture. Eventually there
may be some integration of value for both groups, with a sense of belonging to
the minority group. When resolution of these issues is insufficient, members
may become estranged or marginalized from one or both groups.
Although other perspectives present alternatives to a stage model of minority identity (e.g., Oetting & Beauvais, 1990–1991; Oyserman, Gant, & Ager,
1995; Thompson & Carter, 1997), it is essential to recognize that cultural forces
affect identity development, and in turn influence beliefs, emotions, behavior,
interaction styles, coping strategies, and further experiences within a person’s
social environment. Beginning with the genes and the socialization passed
along by parents, the initial bricks in the wall of identity are marked by cultural
features and references (Worchel, 1999). This cultural identity is an everchanging process.
Other situational social factors may influence the prominence of a cultural identity at any given point as well. The power, prestige, and success of
the group, the perception of costs and benefits associated with group membership, and the opportunity to connect with an orderly and well-defined set of
social practices may increase the salience or importance of a cultural identity,
particularly if a person is experiencing a crisis or some major life event
(Worchel, 1999). In negotiating the turbulent experience of marital dissolution, a common response is to increase affiliation with a religious organization
or church, often the church associated with one’s upbringing. When “Mrs.
Jones” is no longer Mrs. Jones, at least she knows she’s still a Christian, and
can count on the support of her “faith family.” An apt metaphor is offered by
Worchel (1999) to describe the stabilizing functions of cultural identity. “Our
ethnic identity, then, lies like a dog, sleeping by the hearth, waiting to spring
up when a personal or collective crisis confronts us” (p. 46). Further, turning
to the ethnic group during times of transition or personal crisis ensures that
there will always be someone to preserve the continuity of the group. Being a
member of a cultural group provides security and protection, particularly if it
is a dominant group.
Various personality theorists have described normal personal development as the striving to be individual, special, and independent along with striving to be included within a group and to have a secure social identity or sense
of belonging (see, e.g., Brewer, 1991). Integrating or balancing one’s sense of
being unique as well as being part of a social order is certainly influenced by
the larger culture or social environment and how personal identity is constructed within the culture. Both types of striving, to be an individual and to
Working with Cultural Diversity 67
belong to a social group can be expected but will likely vary in the framework
of relevant cultural influences.
Although the construct of culture is admittedly a fuzzy one, it can be related to the specific psychological functioning of the individual through specific
cultural themes or syndromes. In particular, the cultural theme of individualismcollectivism has been successful in describing systematic cultural variations that
affect individual behavior, attitudes, norms, values, goals, family structure, and
sense of self (Triandis, 1996; Vandello & Cohen, 1999).
Western culture, including the United States, is largely individualistic; it
values separate persons whose identity is based on their personal attributes or
accomplishments: what they do. People are motivated to develop attributes
that make them distinct and special, such as intelligence, beauty, talents, or
skills. Entry into social relationships or groups is often based on the person’s
unique or special contributions. Competition takes place between individuals,
and affiliation or acceptance into a group is based on individual merit.
In individualistic cultures, in-groups validate the self-worth of their members and to some extent meet social needs, but individuals try to minimize or
control their dependence on the in-group. The view of self emphasized is that
of private experiences and thoughts related to being a solo entity. Your happiness is not dependent on what “they” think of you, but rather on being true to
your own voice. Personal comfort, satisfaction, and achievement are important,
and a lack of inner harmony is viewed as problematic. Both inner disharmony
or confusion and a lack of distinction may be sources of anxiety or despair. Individualism may allow loose boundaries for social identity, with people moving
in and out of groups relatively easily, meeting new people, forming or disbanding relationships as needed, and making personal choices about which affiliations to select and which to discard. However, many options for group
involvement can lead to confusion and a sense of alienation. Individualistic
cultures exchange compliments frequently, and emphasize fairness and equity
in structuring interactions. Individualists also tend to see themselves as having
access or relative proximity to sources of power.
In contrast, more collectivist cultures of the East and traditional cultures
of Africa and Latin America emphasize external relationships such group
membership and socialization to the expectations of either a specific group or
the generalized other. The role that one has within a group, and how well one
serves the group in that role is key to personal identity, rather than unique personal achievements or interests.
The view of self is a collective one, characterized by perceived appraisals
from the perspective of significant others. The family is usually the most important in-group, but coworkers, religious affiliates, or scientific colleagues may
also form important in-groups. Although the definition of the in-group may
shift, collectivist cultures are organized to protect the integrity of the ingroups, and they may be unwilling to respect or cooperate with members of an
out-group. Boundaries between in-groups and out-groups may be clear and
unyielding. Social behavior is more affected by the in-group versus out-group
distinction within collectivist cultures, particularly in small, tight in-groups
such as the family, and when the in-group norms are highly associated with
important rewards and punishments (e.g., a paycheck).
68 Introduction
Anxiety is caused by in-group disharmony or public conduct that observers perceive as improper. Competition may be fierce, but it takes place between groups such as families. Avoidance of conflict helps to maintain
in-group harmony, and self-denial or suppression may be used to assist conformity. Those in collective cultures not only will do what is expected even if
it is noxious, but will adjust their perceptions to see burdens as enjoyable or
advantageous. Long hours may be spent cooking special foods for a family
gathering, even when the cook dislikes the food or has other pressing tasks;
yet this effort may be viewed as pleasant and worthwhile rather than tedious.
Teens or other family members may be expected to serve the needs of the
family, perhaps by providing child care or working in a family business, even
if it interferes with their personal plans or preferences. In-groups may also
perceive their own norms as universally valid, a form of ethnocentricism
(Triandis, 1995).
The individualism-collectivism theme is more than just tradition, as
these varying dimensions likely serve important social functions for stabilizing
and preserving a culture under certain conditions. Both individualist and collectivist elements are present in all cultures, but in different combinations
(Vandello & Cohen, 1999). Findings by Triandis (1996), indicate that when the
society is affluent, heterogeneous in its people, and complex in offering a
multiplicity of choices, then individualism will be higher. Loose boundaries
and rules are functional and serve to minimize friction between members,
where the context of persons and options is more elaborate or diverse. When
a society has fewer resources, is more homogeneous, has less social mobility
or choices available, or needs members to be interdependent to survive or live
in close proximity, then norms will be more tightly imposed. Secure boundaries and rules also serve to minimize friction between members when options are limited.
Thus, the overall context of the culture plays an important role in how
individual members design a balance between internal experience, personal
identity, and their external involvements and social identity. Without an understanding of this critical context, we run the risk of overemphasizing individualistic assumptions and failing to appreciate social perspective as an
operative and functional basis of personal identity. Our increasingly diverse
patient populations will include those whose personal identity is more allocentric than idiocentric, terms that refer to individuals who carry the values of a
culture of collectivism versus individualism (Triandis, 1995).
Persons who are allocentric may be high on conformity and emphasize interdependence, empathy, and respect among in-group members (Marin &
Marin, 1991). Behavioral intentions of persons who are allocentric are likely to
be most affected by cognitions that relate to the benefit of their culture. A
study of Hispanic (collectivist culture) versus non-Hispanic (individualistic culture) persons revealed notable between-group differences in attitudes that
could affect smoking cessation. Allocentric persons cared more about how
smoking would affect the health of others, set a bad example for children, or
bother others with bad smells. Individualistic persons, on the other hand, were
more concerned with the physiological effects of withdrawal from cigarettes
(Marin, Marin, Otero-Sabogal, Sabogal, & Perez-Stable, 1987).
Working with Cultural Diversity 69
Discussion Exercise
As an exercise in considering how cultural context informs our hypotheses
about patient beliefs, norms, expectations, sources of conflict and possible solutions, consider the following examples of two persons going through an experience of separation and divorce after 8 years of marriage, with no children
involved.
The first patient, Ms. A, has a master’s degree and a successful career as a
nurse administrator. She initiated separation and divorce proceedings due to
her spouse’s irresponsible financial behavior, including gambling debts, and a
lack of sexual intimacy. Ms. A attributes the low sexual intimacy to her own
long-harbored questions about her sexual orientation, but she mostly avoids
thinking about this because of the associated anxiety. She considers herself to
be a good friend and an excellent nursing supervisor, as well as a healthy, smart
person with sophisticated tastes and interests. She is loosely active in a faith
community, and currently attends a divorce support group at her church. She
experiences discomfort in her free time at home on nights and weekends when
she misses the physical presence of another person. She complains of loneliness
and pessimism about the possibility of future remarriage or any sort of relationship. The holidays are particularly difficult, so she assigns herself extra work
shifts to both cover the schedule and fill in her time.
The second patient, Mr. B, has a college degree and works in his familyowned business. He is living separately from his wife, which is a relief from the
strain of daily interactions with her, but he feels tortured by the possibility of
divorce. For at least 3 generations, he and his family have been prominent
members of a tightly organized faith community that regards divorce as unacceptable. The rules of this faith dictate adherence to specific behavioral norms,
and sanctions of eternal damnation in hell for violation of those rules. Mr. B’s
Clinical Example: Doris (Vignette 3)
As an African American and a highly
committed member of her church,
Doris is likely to be more allocentric,
evaluating herself and her experiences
from the perspective of others in her affiliated groups. She takes her role as a
teacher in the church very seriously
and wants to do whatever is needed to
serve this community. It may be culturally consistent for her to subordinate
her personal goals to the needs and directives of her community and the
community leaders.
These observations suggest that Doris
might be more responsive to considering
how her smoking negatively impacts
those in her environment, as opposed to
emphasizing only the effects on her personal health and comfort. She might be
concerned about the cost of smoking as
it affects her family budget or her contributions to the church, and she might
worry about offending her pastor with
smoke-breath at the Wednesday night
fellowship dinner. She might also be especially reluctant to give up the camaraderie of taking a smoke break with her
friends and colleagues. These hypotheses, though, need to be tested for relevance by discussion and exploration
with Doris.
70 Introduction
spouse was also sexually distant and financially irresponsible, spending and
causing debts that threatened the family business. When Mr. B’s father learned
of the financial threat to his business, he insisted, in a loving but firm way, that
Mr. B should do “whatever it takes” to remedy the problem and avoid bringing
the stigma of failure on the family name. Furthermore, it was considered Mr.
B’s responsibility to control his wife’s behavior. No matter how miserable he
might feel about the long hours of work, the financial strain, the lack of marital
intimacy or the degree of marital conflict, divorce was not an option in their
family or religious community. Meanwhile, Mrs. B initiated divorce proceedings. Mr. B complained of feeling hopeless and worthless as a person, and he
was preoccupied with fear of an afterlife in hell. Despite his inner turmoil, he
forced himself to go to work and attend church and family functions because it
was expected by others.
How does the cultural context of beliefs, rules, norms, group affiliation,
and perspective on self-image shape the particular experiences of Mrs. A and
Mr. B? Are they allocentric or idiocentric? What risks or advantages might be
associated with each cultural perspective? What do you think would bring
either of them into therapy? What sort of interventions might be helpful?
Would you have an easier time working with one or the other?
Culturally Sensitive Practice
Culturally sensitive practitioners are aware of the diverse aspects of their own
cultural identity, limits of experience, and stimulus value to others. They understand the cognitive and social processes that shape our judgments and behaviors, and recognize salient cultural differences. In this section, we outline
some basic strategies for building and maintaining cultural sensitivity in applied clinical practice.
You do not necessarily need an entirely new repertoire of clinical skills for
each and every culture, but rather the ability to see the patient’s cultural context, and to appropriately adjust, modify, or develop assessment and interventions practices to be both valid and useful (APA Guidelines, 2003; Bernal,
Bonilla, & Bellido, 1995; S. Sue, 1998). It is the therapist’s responsibility to
speak with the client in a way that accurately taps their worldview and reaches
into their cultural framework.
With assessment techniques, practitioners must keep in mind the fairness
and linguistic understandability for specific individuals, as well as the reference
group for valid test interpretation. Culture-specific therapy may include nontraditional interventions, including strategies or additional helpers in the process of healing. A therapist working with a Native American population might
participate in a “sweat lodge” experience with the tribal elders to gain their
trust and then enlist the elders as participants in certain therapeutic interventions with members of the community.
There is a large continuum of possible adjustments that you might make
to accomplish a culturally sensitive practice. It is easy to be overwhelmed at the
thought of understanding and appropriately responding to the vast array of po-
Working with Cultural Diversity 71
tential cultural variables. This sense of being overwhelmed can already be activated in the beginning practitioner who is just developing basic clinical skills.
And this sense can expand as you delve into the literature and find a burgeoning number of lists, requirements, and tasks to master as part of the notion of
cultural competence (Hansen et al., 2000; Hays, 2001; LaRoche & Maxie, 2003;
Matthews, 1997; Stuart, 2004; Tanaka-Matsumi, Seiden, & Lam, 1996). There
is no mistaking the reality that clinical practice is a complex endeavor, with potential for harm in mislabeling behavior, misdiagnosing problems, misdirecting
treatments, and disrespecting those seeking help. Further, traditional models
that form the basis of most clinical training are, in their Eurocentric, White,
middle-class male focus (see APA Guidelines, 2003; Strickland, 2000), at best
only partially adequate for serving the increasingly diverse population. To cope
with these notable demands, we turn first to a basic grounding in sound ethical
reasoning.
Ethically Based Interventions
Ethical grounding of culturally sensitive practice begins with the principles of
beneficence, nonmaleficence, justice, and respect for human rights and dignity.
These principles are a foundation for sound practice with all clients. We suggest
that practitioners use a series of questions to self-monitor their practice in appropriately conducting treatment amid the vast possible array of cultural issues
that may confront the provider at any given point in time.
• Beneficence: Is this patient (or couple or family) benefiting from treatment?
Are salient cultural expectations taken into consideration in measuring
possible benefits? Is the provider working toward goals that are both important to the patient and consistent with his or her cultural affiliations?
Is the provider using methods and strategies that are a good fit for the patient’s culture? Are there other treatment or community resources that
may better serve their interests?
• Nonmaleficence: Is this treatment plan free of potential harm to the patient? Are issues of cultural risks, including challenges to cultural norms,
given sufficient consideration as potential sources of stress and possible
harm? Is the provider alert to possible personal biases that could affect
the therapy relationship and cause some interpersonal harm to the patient?
• Justice: Is this patient receiving fair access to treatment resources and quality service? Has the tendency to categorize this patient as a member of an
“out-group” affected clinical judgment in any way?
• Respect for human rights and dignity: Is the provider alert to possible stereotypes in working with this patient? Has the provider appropriately discussed relevant issues with the patient so that he or she may have
adequate informed consent to treatment? Have alternative resources and
procedures been discussed? Has the provider taken the time to provide a
sufficient rationale for treatment that targets specific, culturally based
variables such as risk factors?
72 Introduction
In essence, culturally sensitive practice is an ethically based practice in
which care for the patient is the highest priority, and significant effort is made
to ensure benefit, respect, justice, and protection from harm.
Professional Boundary Issues
An area of clinical practice that challenges both novices and veteran practitioners is maintaining the boundaries of appropriate behavior in a professional
context. There is some difference of opinion among those in the profession
as to what constitutes a “boundary” and is appropriate or inappropriate practice (Helbok, Marinelli, & Walls, 2006; Pope, Tabachnick, & Keith-Spiegel,
1987). Questions of boundary violations inevitably come up when adapting
interventions to a patient’s culture, a course of action that might include using
nontraditional interventions, involving community leaders or helpers in the
intervention, or personally participating in culture-specific activities (APA,
2003, p. 392).
Is it a boundary violation to invite the head of the family to participate in
the treatment of a family member when the family is from a collectivist culture? Do you violate the patient’s boundaries by declining to involve pertinent
family members? Do you violate proper therapeutic boundaries by participating in a culturally important ritual with members of the patient’s community
to better understand their culture and to gain trust and rapport? What if the
patient wants to introduce the therapist to family at large, so that they will
know and trust him? Should the therapist accept an invitation to a family event
in the interest of culturally sensitive practice? Is the acceptance of a token gift a
boundary violation, or conversely, is it the refusal of the gift that is the boundary violation? Does age or disability status make a difference in determining
proper therapy boundaries?
These complex questions require a sensitive reasoning of each instance,
and judgment based on individual situations. A boundary violation might
occur if any or all of the following consequences result from the provider’s decisions or actions: (a) It causes the therapist to lose objectivity with regard to
the patient; (b) it exploits the patient in any way; and (c) it disrupts or derails
the ongoing treatment (Younggren, 2004).
It is incumbent on therapists to consider issues such as diagnosis, level of
functioning of the patient, and local standards and practices when considering
the impact of their actions. Consultation with other qualified professionals,
especially those who might be cognizant of the relevant cultural norms and
practices, is also an important step in supporting one’s reasoning as far as
adapting clinical methods (Younggren & Gottlieb, 2004). Under no condition
could an action that would violate basic standards of care be rationalized as a
cultural adaptation if it causes the therapist to lose objectivity, exploits the patient, or disrupts ongoing treatment. Engaging in sexual intimacy with the patient would always violate these standards, no matter what the cultural
standard. On the other hand, a therapist might participate in a cultural ritual
with the leaders of a community, such as the Native American sweat lodge
previously mentioned, and this would not necessarily violate any of the basic
standards of care.
Working with Cultural Diversity 73
Consultation with colleagues on cultural matters should be done tactfully
and in the context of a broader collegial or professional relationship. If possible,
consult with colleagues on the basis of their clinical or research experience in
working with the population of interest, or their expressed interest in the culture. In a survey of ethnic minority therapists, some reported the experience of
being viewed as an “expert” on their particular ethnic group as a positive one,
whereas others found it insulting that they would be perceived as helpful only
on matters of ethnicity (Iwamasa, 1996). Consultations with colleagues who
are just as unfamiliar with the culture of interest may result in further confusion, and perhaps misapplication of standards of care.
Therapists need to assess their own boundaries of competence when
working with a particular population and be alert to circumstances where an
understanding of cultural factors is essential for effective service, as noted in
Ethical Standard 2.01 (b) (APA, 2002). This standard also holds that therapists
must obtain relevant training, experience, consultation, or supervision as necessary, or make appropriate referral. Thus, in dealing with matters of age, gender, gender identity, race, ethnicity, culture, national origin, religion, sexual
orientation, disability, language, or socioeconomic status, we must seek enough
information and consultation or supervision to provide competent service that
is beneficial and not harmful to the patient, or help locate more appropriate, alternative resources.
Four Action Strategies
Good intentions are just that, unless there is a clear action plan for behavioral
implementation. Although it is beyond the scope of this chapter to thoroughly
delineate cultural competence in practice (see LaRoche & Maxie, 2003; Stuart,
2004; S. Sue, 1998), we offer the following four recommendations for building
and maintaining clinical skills in the cultural domain.
Action Strategy One: A Personal Cultural Inventory
First, take a personal cultural inventory, and periodically update it. Knowing
yourself and your primary identifications is the foundation for understanding
your assumptions, values, and possible biases, as well as comprehending your
potential impact on others. Cultivating awareness of your own cultural identity
is a vital step in countering ethnocentricism or the tendency to generalize your
own worldview as an assumed perspective. By acknowledging and accepting
yourself as a person with a particular point of view that is grounded in certain
cultural dimensions, you become more practiced in recognizing the importance
of cultural identity in yourself and others.
There are many different ways to explore your cultural identity. A thorough approach is detailed in Hays (2001) with multiple dimensions summarized in the acronym ADDRESSING. This stands for the cultural influences of
age and generational influences, developmental or acquired disabilities, religion
and spiritual orientation, ethnicity, socioeconomic status, sexual orientation,
indigenous heritage, national origin, and gender. This thorough approach offers
a broad overview of cultural identity and helps the therapist discern any specific dimensions that may be particularly salient.
74 Introduction
Other broad questions may be useful in exploring your personal cultural
inventory. How would you describe yourself in terms of cultural identity?
What comes to mind as important in describing you, at this point in time? Do
you think that your values and priorities are more allocentric or individualistic? What are the groups or communities that are or have been important to
you? Do you place high value on your group affiliations or are you loosely tied
to these commitments?
For a simple exercise to assess your perspective, complete 20 sentences
that begin with the stem “I am . . .” This is a method used by researchers to assess cultural perspectives of the self (e.g., Higgins & King, 1981). Once you
have completed the list, review each item to see if there is a reference to a social group (e.g., I am a mother; I am a native Floridian), a generalized public
perspective (e.g., I am viewed as responsible), or a private statement (I am
hard-working). Social references suggest an allocentric perspective, and private
self responses suggest individualistic perspective, with public perspective being
relatively infrequent (Triandis, 1995).
What elements of your cultural identity do you think have the most impact
on your professional role? When patients meet you for the first time, what will
strike them about you as a person? Remember, qualities are not static, but are perceived from the perspective of the other person. The therapist’s personal impact is
perceived by the client in terms of similarities and differences. What do your potential patients want to know about you to make an informed choice about working with you, and accepting your influence? Are you willing to answer inquiries
about personal matters, and if so, how will you address issues of differences?
Although answering patient inquiries is influenced by the theoretical approach taken and the case conceptualization, the principles of informed consent and respect for patient autonomy suggest that it is important to address
patient concerns directly and early in treatment, and support the patient’s right
to choose providers, even if this results in being rejected. Cultural sensitivity
also helps us to better understand why the patient asks these questions. An individualistic person might be more concerned with inquiring about your degrees and where you went to school. This feels culturally consistent to an
individualistic therapist, who easily answers such questions and views them as
appropriate. On the other hand, an allocentric person might not be highly concerned with your degree, but places trust in you on the basis of your affiliation
with an important group or the recommendation of a respected authority.
Common areas of cultural inquiry from patients include parental status (do
you have children of your own?), religious orientation (Are you a Christian? Are
you Jewish? What is your attitude toward Muslims?), sexual orientation or appreciation of different orientations (Are you heterosexual? How do you deal
with gay or lesbian people?), socioeconomic status (Do you understand what it is
like to have a low or high income?), or simply willingness to disclose basic personal information (e.g., where you grew up). By carefully and selectively sharing
some of this personal information (in the context of professional conduct), the
therapist might establish an “in-group” bond with the patient, a fundamental
step in developing trust and rapport. However, beginning therapists should be
aware that effective self-disclosure in a clinical setting requires considerable
judgment and skill. One must learn to strike a balance between the extremes of
Working with Cultural Diversity 75
sharing too much information and stonewalling the patient’s attempts to be informed about the clinician’s experience and possible sources of bias. As you are
learning the skills of therapy, caution and restraint in self-disclosure is the best
beginning posture. Gradually, you can learn how to provide limited information
for the sole purpose of serving the patient’s best interests.
These sorts of questions can be viewed as a welcome invitation by the patient to form a relationship, not as threats to your competence. No one can represent all cultural variations, or be fully conversant in aspects of different
cultures. If you are clear in knowing your own cultural identity, have an appreciation of its possible impact with patients, and understand how to maintain the
boundaries of your professional role, you will likely be more confident in discussing questions raised by the patient. An appreciation of important cultural
variations can also help you effectively understand the importance of the question from the patient’s point of view.
In instances where you may differ from the patient’s cultural preference,
but you believe that you have competent skills for helping him or her, you can
address the underlying issue of trust with a statement of reassurance. The following is a response to an inquiry about your family status:
I am married, but do not have children of my own. However, I do have experience in
helping families with troubled teens, and I am committed to offering my skills and
perspective to you in dealing with your current family issues. If you’re willing to give
it a try, we can see if you feel comfortable and can benefit from our work together.
However, if you would prefer to work with someone who is also experienced as a parent, I will be happy to provide you with the names of other qualified providers.
If there are cultural differences between yourself and your patient, it is
important to ask yourself whether you have the emotional or intellectual competence to accept the patient. If not, how will the patient’s best interests be
served? In some instances, you may decide that you can acquire enough intellectual competence through some additional continuing education. This may be
most adaptive when there are no significantly better alternative resources, and
cultural issues are not directly relevant to the presenting problem. This could
occur when a patient seeks treatment for panic attacks, and also happens to be
gay and Christian and is not struggling with either of these identities. However,
if you are not sure you have the emotional or intellectual competence for
working with someone of a particular group, even if that is not a presenting
issue, then responsible case management would indicate referring the patient
to alternative resources.
Determining the patient’s best interest in matters of cultural difference or
similarity with the therapist should also include a collaborative element. Even
though it may be uncomfortable to bring it up, this decision deserves the patient’s direct involvement. The important element is to convey openness to recognizing and discussing differences as they may matter to the patient, without
making assumptions about the patient’s perspective. This means not assuming
that the patient considers it difficult to work with you, because of a cultural
difference, or would be either comfortable or uncomfortable in discussing the
matter. The following is an example of how to open such a discussion:
76 Introduction
My goal is to be as helpful to you as I possibly can, and to address anything that
might affect our working productively together. As part of getting to know each
other, I would like us to be open about any questions or concerns that come up.
There are always differences between people in terms of cultural background, and
sometimes that matters, sometimes not. If there are differences between us that you
think might matter, or be worth discussing, would you be willing to talk about it?
Likewise, if we find common ground, let’s try to take note of that. How does that
sound to you?
The discussion of cultural differences does not always proceed gently.
There may be strong affect associated with both the cultural difference, and the
power difference between patient and therapist. These combined elements will
make some patients more submissive while others may become highly defensive and emotionally reactive to the therapist. They may present a barrage of
questions about your background or qualifications, or judgments of your competence. Although such reactions may feel like an attack, they can, if handled
empathically, lead into a productive discussion of cultural differences. An
African American patient in family therapy reacted to the Caucasian therapist’s
attempts to engage her in discussion of parenting issues by angrily exclaiming,
“I’m sick and tired of you White bitches trying to tell me how to raise my kids.”
This was a clear opportunity for the therapist to pursue discussion of the racial
difference issue, and to learn more about the patient’s perspective. To counter
with either anger or defensiveness would entirely lose this opportunity.
Clinical Example: Doris (Vignette 4)
Let’s return to our consideration of
Doris. If Doris’s medical team had taken
their own personal cultural inventory,
they might have been more alert to
some of the perceived differences between themselves and their patient. All
members of the team were fairly young
(under 45 years of age), and they represented a traditional power structure of
a Caucasian male (the physician) being
assisted by a group of Caucasian females. Further, they all had a slender
body size and tended to organize experience from an individualistic perspective.
A greater cognizance of these cultural
differences as having some potential impact on the interaction with Doris might
have helped the team realize the crucial
importance of taking time to develop
trust and rapport, helping Doris to see
herself as an actual participating member of the team and not just another case
on a long list. They might have been
more successful in gaining her involvement by getting to know her as a person
and allowing her to get to know them
before dispensing advice on how she
should change. Instead, they expected
her to have assumptions that matched
their own about valuing individual
health and taking personal responsibility for maintaining health, and they misjudged her readiness to change. No one
took the time to inquire about Doris’s
perceptions of the team and possible
barriers that might affect her ability to
trust and relate to them.
Working with Cultural Diversity 77
Action Strategy Two: Continuing Education
For the second action strategy, continue to seek new information and learn
about beliefs, values, and practices of various cultures and subcultures. There
are many experiential ways to come into contact with cultural diversity. Seek
opportunities to get to know people who are members of groups that are different from your own. Expose yourself to reading materials that represent a wide
range of audiences. Participate in an event or gathering that represents an opportunity to share in the practices of a certain culture or group, even if it is not
something you are particularly inclined toward.
This approach can take on a superficial cast if not done in a spirit of openness to seek new information. Eating dinner at the Chinese buffet is not a particularly strong exercise in cultural diversity. However, you can make an effort
to interact with individuals of Asian descent when the opportunity presents itself. By taking an interest in the people, you can find the opportunity to better
understand possible aspects of a culture. A snippet of exposure does not create
expertise, but it is a beginning.
For a simple exercise, again take an inventory, this time a quick one. During any given day, how many times do you have contact with someone of a
racial or ethnic background different from your own? Include incidental contacts such as people you might easily speak to in passing. How many of those
contacts do you see as an opportunity for learning something about cultural
experiences different from your own? Do you speak to the Egyptian cab
driver? Do you allow yourself to learn anything about his experience as someone of Arab descent? Perhaps challenge yourself to learn something new about
someone else’s cultural experience at least once a week or more. If you are
Christian, ask a Jewish friend if you can participate in her Seder supper. Go
ahead and talk about the differences in Jewish and Christian customs. Some information may seep in through sheer exposure, but it is much more likely to be
a culturally informative experience if you make it a point to learn something
related to the person’s cultural background.
Scholarly or academic forms of continuing education on cultural diversity
are key aspects of the second action strategy. Culture can be a continuing education theme or topic to which you return again and again throughout the
course of a career. Scholarly literature that informs our clinical work within
various cultural contexts is very useful and increasingly available (see Appendix 3.1). Where specific guidelines exist (APA, 2000a, 2002, 2004), it is important to become familiar with those guidelines and to keep a reference copy
handy for review and consultation as needed. Books on the topic of multicultural practice (e.g., Aponte & Wohl, 2000) as well as texts related to issues concerning particular populations or groups (e.g., Adams, 1995; Boyd-Franklin,
2003; Helms, 1990) can expand your cognitive or intellectual grasp of cultural
matters as they may affect patients.
There is a growing list of journals devoted to the study of diversity (see
Appendix 3.1). Empirical studies concerning certain cultural populations also
appear with some frequency in other topical journals (e.g., Bernal et al., 1995;
Nilsson & Anderson, 2004). In addition, selected web site resources may provide useful summary information about mental health issues and other matters related to specific cultural groups. The United States Department of Health
78 Introduction
and Human Services offers a detailed report from the office of the Surgeon
General concerning culture, race, ethnicity, and mental health. In addition to
independent reading, many excellent workshops or continuing education seminars offered by professional organizations provide opportunities to keep expanding your externally developed knowledge base (see Appendix 3.1 for more
resources).
This recommendation for ongoing learning also merits a caveat of recognizing the impossibility of ever completing the task (LaRoche & Maxie, 2003).
Students delving into material concerning different broad cultural groups often
have a similar initial reaction of realizing the group actually comprises many
subgroups. Arab Americans might have family originating from any of 20 or
more countries with significant Arab populations (Erickson & Al-Timimi,
2001). Further, approximately two-thirds of Arab Americans were born in the
United States, as there have been at least three waves of Arab immigration, beginning in the 1880s. With this scratch to the surface of the Arab culture, we
begin to see the possible complexity, even before considering religion, acculturation stresses, or educational standing.
We must seek information so that we are not completely culture ignorant,
yet recognize that superficial knowledge will not result in an overall competence. The risk of a little superficial knowledge, without recognizing its limits,
could be overgeneralization and treating a patient as a member of a class or category. Instead, we hope that knowledge gained from studying about a group
can be used to inform hypotheses about specific people. Given the vast array of
cultures and cultural combinations and permutations, we recognize the need to
have a strategy of openness and caring about each unique client, combined
with curiosity about cultural influences. To attempt to present ourselves as
knowledgeable about all cultures can only be a pretense, and one that violates
the values of honesty and genuineness that are expected in psychotherapy
(Wohl, 2000).
Clinical Example: Doris (Vignette 5)
The diabetes team that worked with
Doris was a top-notch group of health
professionals who were diligent in their
ongoing continuing education. After
their consultation with Doris, several
members of the team attended the annual conference of the Society of Behavioral Medicine. While there, they heard a
presentation on the concept of religious
health fatalism as it affects members
of the African American faith community (Franklin, Schlundt, & Wallston, in
press). They learned about the importance of religious affiliation in the
African American community and how
certain beliefs about faith and health
may substantially affect subsequent
health-related behavior. This provided
the team with some ideas to explore with
Doris concerning culturally based beliefs
and attitudes affecting her response to
their interventions. Doris might hold the
belief, “I don’t need to try to improve my
health because I know it is up to God.”
Or, “If God wants me to have better
health, He will provide.”
Working with Cultural Diversity 79
Action Strategy Three: Beware of Cultural Cookbooks
Continuously seeking new information leads us directly to the third action
strategy, which is to beware of the simplicity of cultural cookbooks. A person is
not simply a product of a singular cultural group. Social categorization is an
automatic process that aims to simplify the world, but with significant risk of
overgeneralization. As you go about gathering more information about cultures, be sure to look for information that is consistent and inconsistent with
group practices or norms.
In clinical work, it is especially important to suspend preconceptions about
patients based on cultural background, and to recognize that patients may indeed be quite different from others in the group in which they appear to belong
(Cardemil & Battle, 2003). No individual person is a living representation of all
aspects of a culture, and no culture is so homogeneous that all generalizations
apply to all members (Wohl, 2000). Sometimes the recognition of possible divergence from expected cultural patterns is a significant clinical issue, and can give
rise to important personal exploration. If patients are Hispanic, that does not automatically mean they will be Catholic. If they are Hispanic and Catholic, that
also does not mean that their distress is necessarily related to difficulties in
family relations. Hispanic and Catholic cultures are traditionally collectivistoriented, yet it may be that the educational and economic aspects of the patient’s
culture are the salient issues and the clinically significant concern revolves
around trying to succeed in a highly competitive environment.
For each patient, find out how demonstrated distress may or may not be
related to ethnic or cultural issues. We might expect that in times of relative
stress, crisis, or transition, the patient’s sense of belonging to some identified
cultural group will be salient. The person who does not have a sense of belonging, or who seems to have lost the belief in belonging is likely to be in the greatest degree of distress. It may be that changes in the patient’s life have caused
corresponding changes in cultural associations, or rendered a previous association more tenuous or even nonexistent.
Clinical Example: Doris (Vignette 6)
Doris eventually made her way back to
the diabetes clinic after being urged to
do so by her primary care physician.
She returned to the PCP because of vision changes and tingling in her hands
and feet, symptoms that scared her. The
doctor said this was peripheral neuropathy caused by her diabetes. After
Doris met with the team, the psychologist scheduled an extended visit so they
could take an in-depth psychosocial
health history. This step allowed the
team to better understand Doris and
her health needs, to explore the ambivalence Doris seemed to have about
making changes, and to discuss specific
ways that culture affected her health
problems.
During this history taking, it became
clear that Doris was concerned that her
body size detracted from her appearance, even though she did not view extreme thinness as the only attractive
form. She was indeed concerned with
the health risks related to obesity. However, she also endorsed many beliefs
(continued)
Action Strategy Four: Keep a Multidimensional Focus
Finally, keep the multi in multicultural, remembering that all persons are multidimensional. There are many aspects of a cultural identity, and full understanding of a client cannot happen if we assign too much weight to one or two
cultural variables. For example, one of the most common cultural misconceptions encountered among young clinicians in training is the belief that all older
persons are more alike than they are different. This automatic reaction is
based on assigning too much weight to a single cultural variable (age) and assuming that the out-group is highly similar in composition, and less desirable
as a group.
In fact, there are more differences between age groups than not. Older
adults as a group are more heterogeneous than other age groups (APA, 2004;
Crowther & Zeiss, 2003; Nelson & Dannefer, 1992). Brief reflection usually
makes clear how this stereotype of similarity of all older people is just that, a
stereotype. In a group of persons at age 75, you are likely to find a notable
range of cognitive functioning and possible clinical symptoms, physical health
and mobility, emotional well-being, social engagement and access to friends,
economic status, daily living circumstances, and responsibilities including employment and the care of grandchildren or other dependents. Compared with
clinical trainees at age 25, there are far more differences within the elder
group. And these differences can reflect degrees of greater rather than lesser
desirability compared with those of the younger group. Many elders have plentiful free time, high economic status, comfortable living arrangements and
freedom from responsibility, close connections with loved ones, good physical
health, stable emotional well-being and a strong sense of life satisfaction. A
multidimensional perspective is required for understanding someone in either

characteristic of religiously based health
fatalism. Her ambivalence about taking
action was affected by these fatalistic
beliefs, as well as the tension between
the perspective of her in-group and priorities of her community, and the
team’s expectation of a substantially individualist focus on her health needs.
Thus, the psychologist advised the
team to encourage Doris to view her
weight management as an important
contribution to her family. They provided specific information to her on the
mechanisms of health impairment in
obesity and diabetes. This helped Doris
see the connection between these two
conditions and others in her family who
eventually died from the medical consequences. By helping her to understand
how diabetes could cause breakdown of
the vascular system that would harm
her heart, kidneys, and nervous system,
the team helped Doris realize that the
disease progression was not inevitable.
To specifically address her religiously
based fatalistic beliefs, the team might
also suggest that perhaps God was providing this information to help her improve her health. They could gently
guide her toward resolving the tension
between her commitment to her social
affiliations, and her need to attend to
her personal health.
group, with an appreciation of how the magnitude of differences may vary
within groups.
Cultural affiliations may shift or change across a life span. Our culture is
heterogeneous, with boundaries that are to some degree loose or fluid. Given
the complexity of our society, there is also a general expectation of cultural
adaptability or change to meet the demands of varying circumstances. However, both internal and external barriers affect psychological and social shifts in
cultural participation. Boundaries that should be open, or appear to be open
may in fact be only semipermeable. Emotional and behavioral stress associated
with encountering and crossing cultural boundaries is an important clinical
consideration.
A minority student from a low-income, single-parent family attends a
competitive college preparatory academy. His mother feels strongly that this
opportunity will provide many advantages for her son’s future, yet she endures
constant ridicule from her coworkers for all the time, effort, and expense required to support his full participation in school activities. The support offered
by the in-group of other parents at the academy may be good, it may be marginal, or the atmosphere may be downright hostile to this scholarship student.
Internally, the student may wish to both please his mother, and gain access to
the world of privilege in the academy, yet feel guilt over the growing distance
from old friends, his neighborhood culture, and the emotional and financial
strain on his mother.
Working with Cultural Diversity 81
Clinical Example: Doris (Vignette 7)
Let’s revisit why Doris did not respond
immediately to the recommendations
of the diabetes team. Her actions were
both similar and dissimilar to what
might be expected just on the basis of
her age, race, and gender. First, she had
the sense of mistrust in the health care
system that may be common among
African Americans. However, she did
not hold the attitudes of large body size
acceptance that others expected based
on her age and race. She had a strong
religious affiliation that might have
been predicted by her race, but religious affiliation alone does not explain
her response to the first diabetes consult. Rather, her religious fatalism is the
psychological component that most affected her health-related behavior.
The prevalence of certain health conditions and behaviors within her culture may have had notable impact on
her thinking. The salience of seeing diabetes, hypertension, and obesity as
common among her friends and family
needed to be acknowledged by the team
as a perspective different from their
own. For the team, these were serious
conditions that merited significant time
and attention. For Doris, these conditions were just part of everyday living,
and health deterioration was a matter
of God’s plan. Finally, as an allocentric
person, Doris was particularly conflicted by the expectation that she invest
more time and energy attending to a
personal choice when she believed that
her community did not think this was a
necessary or important use of her time
or resources.
Summary
In a complex society with many options as ours, openness, understanding, flexibility, and self-awareness are key elements of working with cultural similarities and differences. In conducting psychotherapy, it is likely that we encounter
people who are adjusting or revising their cultural identity as they progress
through their lives, encountering inevitable changes in opportunities and circumstances. Facilitating this process can be a fulfilling challenge.
Instead of trying to ascertain fixed aspects of the patient’s cultural identity
based on group stereotypes, and trying to alleviate distress by creating a better
fit with this given identity, we can embrace the notion of cultural identity as an
ongoing process. Psychotherapy offers a protected relationship where cultural
limits and opportunities are acknowledged and explored. The role of the therapist can be likened to that of a guide who helps the patient sort out the cultural
pressures and options impinging on psychosocial adaptation. In an ethically
grounded practice, understanding the multiple dimensions of culture is vital to
understanding and effectively helping our diverse clientele. Culturally attuned
practitioners take a personal cultural inventory and periodically update it. They
are careful about self-disclosure, but respect the client’s right to be informed
about the therapist’s cultural influences. Culturally attuned practitioners continually seek new information about various cultures and subcultures, but
avoid the oversimplicity of cultural cookbooks. Instead, they maintain a multidimensional perspective on culture and its many implications.



Because science and practice are two cornerstones of clinical psychology,
clinical research and outcome assessment can be considered as the building blocks of clinical practice. Various research methods are used in clinical
psychology, including case studies and qualitative research designs. The objectives of clinical research are twofold. The first objective is to build a scientific
foundation for understanding normal and abnormal human behavior or
psychopathology. The second objective is to determine which interventions are
effective in changing or adjusting problematic behavior and emotional disorders, and under what conditions these interventions are known to be effective.
The quality and usefulness of any clinical intervention is directly tied to the
quality of its empirical support.

interventions.

observational designs.
• Describe the pros and cons of single-subject designs and case study research.

84 Introduction
Having gained an appreciation for the many specialties in the field of clinical psychology, the variations in degrees and requirements for practitioners in
this field, and individual and cultural diversity in the practitioners and consumers of clinical psychology, you should begin to wonder what techniques,
treatments, and protocols are available to clinicians for helping people with
clinical needs. How do consumers, clients, or patients, know what type of therapy to seek? How can insurance companies justify paying for mental health services or verify that therapy is effective? How does the field substantiate itself
compared with other alternative therapies for alleviating suffering and improving psychological well-being?
This chapter reviews a sample of empirical research strategies used to test
clinical therapies and techniques for a broad range of populations and disorders. The generalization of clinical research to clinical practice is explored, with
descriptions of empirically supported treatments, evidence-based practice, and
manually driven therapies. Pros and cons of these developments are addressed,
and the field’s means of dissemination is reviewed. Future chapters explore
how clinicians develop a treatment plan and select certain techniques from
among the standardized treatments and protocols.
Clinical Research and Research Methods
Research in clinical psychology spans the gamut of research methods, designs,
and adherence to general principles of science. Investigations vary from use of
highest-constraint to lowest-constraint methods, with a wide range of strategies
and techniques between these two artificial anchors. Numerous research
methods are covered in research courses you will take, so only those relevant
to outcomes research are described here. High-constraint research refers to
methods and designs in which the conditions, variables, and participants are
scrupulously screened and selected for specific traits or characteristics desired
by the researcher to isolate what is being studied from any possible confounds, or undesired interference in the study. Quantitative experimental and
quasi-experimental designs are categorized as varying degrees of highest constraint research. These are the research designs you probably most often think
of because pharmaceutical companies and other funding agencies provide financial support for treatment outcome studies using these designs, and therefore, radio and newspaper advertisements seeking participants are plentiful
(e.g., “Are you feeling sad, blue, hopeless, depressed . . . the University of
Somewhere is conducting a study to test a new medication to help you. Please
call to see if you qualify.”).
Lowest constraint research describes studies that use methods and designs where the investigator—while creating little if any interference—
observes conditions, variables, and participants in natural surroundings or
circumstances. Examples of lower constraint research include observational,
correlational, and archival studies. When participants complete a packet of
Clinical Research and Outcome Assessment 85
questionnaires based on personal characteristics or experiences, but do
not enroll in any interventional program, such studies exemplify this type
of research. Similarly, reviews of insurance company information that
compile statistics of the types of patients who have positive outcomes in psychotherapy is archival (lower constraint) research. The case study, which
is classified as lower constraint research, has recently gained more attention
in the research and practice of clinical psychology because of its potential for
significantly affecting systematic treatment selection. In line with this research, practitioner-scholars advocate for the development of local clinical
science. In this approach, clinicians adopt an outcomes-focused treatment
and apply research methodology to their evaluation of practice on a case-bycase basis. The aggregate of case-based data acquired through practice would
then inform other clinicians and researchers about the effectiveness of
treatment interventions with clients who are not screened for uniformity in
their presentations or for control of confounding variables in settings or
treatment.
Some biases exist about which types of research are more scholarly
or meritorious, but the knowledgeable psychologist recognizes that the goal of
the research dictates the design and methodology chosen, and that almost
all methodologies have their limits and flaws. The choice of research design
and methodology should be made by using honed critical thinking and rational decision-making skills toward achieving the goal of answering research
questions.
Clinical psychologists whose work crosses the research-practice spectrum
can appreciate the need for bridging the gaps between the two subspecialties of
the field. True scientist-practitioners recognize the important contributions
made by clinicians and researchers, and the current limitations of both areas of
practice. The following basic explanations of several research designs are helpful in understanding the subsequent review of where the field stands in applying research to practice, and having practice inform research in the service of
human psychological welfare. While the decision-making skills to be employed
are beyond the scope of this chapter, the problem-solving model of clinical
decision making (A. M. Nezu, Nezu, & Lombardo, 1999) can be useful for considering clinical problems and choosing relevant research applications to evaluate them, or for selecting empirically validated or evidenced-based methods for
use in practice.
Research Designs
Experimental research (“true research”) and quasi-experimental research are families of designs that are typically used in research laboratories or research clinics
with large numbers of participants, comparison groups, and multiple data collection points (pretreatment, posttreatment, follow-up time frames). They involve a high degree of input, manipulation, and selection of participants, or
control of environmental, treatment, therapist, and participant characteristics.
These designs are often used to determine cause and effect in examination of
86 Introduction
two or more independent and dependent variables.* Random selection, random assignment, and control groups define the differences between experimental and
quasi-experimental research and other research designs. Randomized controlled
trials (RCTs) are often the basis for discovering empirically supported treatments, as defined later on. Researchers randomly select and assign participants
to experimental conditions (e.g., treatment groups, exposure to different environmental stimuli) and compare those who get a dose of the experimental variable with those who do not. In this way, researchers can draw conclusions
about the relationships between variables that investigators observing individuals independent of each other cannot. The influence these parameters have on
controlling the threats or confounds to the interpretation of the results is significant, but not without criticism.
Experimental designs employ random selection when feasible, and random assignment as a defining feature. Quasi-experimental designs use random
selection often to the extent that experimental designs do, but the population,
setting, or other features of the independent variable prohibit random assignment. Random selection and random assignment represent different aspects of
research methods and procedure, and have different implications for interpreting the outcomes. Students and those new to research often confuse these
terms, and therefore, a careful explanation follows.
Random Selection
Random selection requires that each participant in an overall population has
an equal chance of being selected. How the population is defined is the key to
determining the likelihood of employing random selection. Selecting a random
sample from the population of clinical child psychologists would require identifying and potentially recruiting all clinical child psychologists for a given
study. This would mean that psychologists from all over the world would need
to be identified (with credentials and training being equivalent), and then a
random sample of this population would be selected. For most studies, based
on feasibility due to budget and logistics among other reasons, the likelihood of
a true random selection of this population would be unrealistic. Simply determining the equality of degrees and training across cultures would be a tremendous task. As such, psychology studies typically use a convenience sample
restricted by such things as geographic location, accessibility, or volunteer sta-
* Independent variables are the input variables, or the variables that the investigator chooses to
exist in an expected and determined way. Examples of independent variables include race, gender, therapy type (e.g., psychopharmacology, cognitive-behavioral therapy, family therapy),
years of training, or degree of depression (mild, moderate, severe). Dependent variables are the
output variables, or the variables that are expected to be affected by the input variables. These
are the variables the researchers are watching to see if and how they change as a result of the independent variable. Independent and dependent variables are often thought of as part of an
“if/then” statement. For example, “If severely depressed persons engage in cognitive-behavioral
therapy (CBT), then they will experience a decrease in depression and increase in quality of life
following therapy, compared with (if) severely depressed persons who do not engage in CBT.
Therapy is the independent variable that is selected by the researcher; quality of life and posttreatment depression (or changes in depression scores) are the dependent variables.
Clinical Research and Outcome Assessment 87
tus. If, however, the population of “clinical child psychologists” was further defined as “Pennsylvania licensed clinical child psychologists in Philadelphia,”
and you were a researcher living in that area, random selection might be more
feasible. You could verify a list of qualified psychologists from the state regulatory board licensure rosters and would need to establish some inclusion and exclusion criteria to determine who is a child psychologist, and what constitutes
practice in Philadelphia. The selection method would then require giving each
psychologist an equal chance of being chosen for the study. This latter scenario
is potentially feasible on a limited budget and time schedule.
Random Assignment
Supposing that you now have selected people to participate in your research
study, how will you decide who gets what treatment, by whom, or when? Or,
how will you decide which therapist will conduct therapy for which individuals
or groups? In true experiments (experimental design), participants would be
randomly assigned to each of the experimental conditions. This means that
each participant (already selected to participate in the study-at-large) has an
equal chance of being placed in any of the experimental conditions. So, if you
were testing the differences between cognitive-behavioral therapy and nondirective supportive psychotherapy, ideally each participant would have a 50/50
chance of being assigned to one of these conditions, and this assignment would
occur essentially by a method similar to flipping a coin. Thus, the independent
variable lends itself to a true experimental design.
If you are comparing the impact of cognitive-behavioral therapy on treating
generalized anxiety disorder in persons who have a significant other (spouse or
partner) with those who do not, you cannot randomly assign your participants
to groups. The characteristics of your sample will dictate which group they are
in—they either come to therapy having a significant other, or they do not have a
significant other. Thus, the independent variable is not randomly assigned. There
is no variation in each participant’s likelihood of being in a particular group—
they are either in it, or they are not. In quasi-experimental research, therefore,
investigators are studying the cause and effect of independent and dependent
variables, but the study is created, in part, around existing conditions or characteristics of the participants, the setting, therapy conditions (e.g., therapist characteristics), or other features of the independent variable already in place. The
design is still experimental because cause and effect is being studied, and there is
manipulation of some aspect or at least one independent variable; in the preceding case, the investigator is manipulating therapy condition.
There are many variations to experimental and quasi-experimental designs with regard to sampling techniques (e.g., how participants are selected),
type of comparison groups to be used against what is being studied (e.g., comparing your treatment to no treatment, or to a different kind of treatment),
methods to minimize sources of artifacts and bias, types of variables being investigated, and even the components of the study that identify the potent factors of an intervention. The interested reader is referred to research methods
textbooks (e.g., Kazdin, 2003) for more detail.
Observational study designs are a lower-constraint type of research than
experimental designs, but also with high yield of information. As with the
88 Introduction
experimental and quasi-experimental designs, researchers can often identify
cause and effect from variables studied with this methodology, but the researchers’ role is to observe rather than to affect or intervene with the variables. Observational designs examine naturally existing variables (e.g.,
height, personality disorder), or variables that result from naturally occurring
circumstances (meaning the investigator does not create them, e.g., pregnancy, trauma experience, medical disorder).
Observational designs can answer numerous research questions. These
designs may be used as precursors to treatment outcome studies to support the
need for intervention development, or for posttreatment studies to observe
populations’ functioning or well-being over time. Likewise, treatment efficacy
(whether the treatment works in regular settings or circumstances) studies
might utilize observational studies because interventions may be evaluated in
their natural settings, without manipulation of treatment variables, therapist
variables, or patient variables. For this type of study, it would be important to
follow up on an empirical finding that a particular intervention works under
ideal laboratory settings. Benefits of observational designs are that multiple
variables can be considered simultaneously because there is less of an attempt
to control for all confounding variables (e.g., noise or distracting factors) in a
study. Observational designs might be less expensive than employing experimental designs, and more information may be obtained as to how well the
treatment will generalize to applications in real world settings.
Qualitative research studies are another form of lowest-constraint research
designs. Qualitative studies have a different purpose and result than quantitative research, yet they are both empirical approaches to obtaining new knowledge. Instead of summarizing findings about relationships between variables
based on large groups of participants, qualitative research aims to expand and
broaden the understanding of a particular topic or phenomenon. Such studies usually
depend on a small number of participants or groups of participants (interviewing each group as one participant) and are not typically hypothesis driven.
Qualitative research often takes the form of semi- or unstructured interviews
to investigate a rare or poorly understood condition, experience, or circumstance, individualized responses to given circumstances, or something typically
deemed personal or private (e.g., use of spiritual guidance). Perhaps, the focus
is on aspects of a person’s thoughts, feelings, or behaviors that require elaboration rather than on concise responses to pencil-and-paper tests. Interviews
allow for in-depth responses by participants that might not otherwise be acquired. Data takes the form of narratives, stories, or even words used. Data is
typically analyzed by a collaboration of interpreters or by software used to analyze words or phrases that summarize the gist of materials.
Although different from quantitative methodology, qualitative research
uses legitimate methodology and is a “systematic, replicable, and cumulative”
approach to research (Kazdin, 2003, p. 329). Qualitative research can help develop a particular theory, or to identify variables important to study using
quantitative methods. Interviews with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) persons and their caregivers helped determine relevant aspects of quality of life
(QOL) for this population to be included in a later-developed QOL instrument
(Simmons et al., 2006).
Clinical Research and Outcome Assessment 89
The possible roles for qualitative research in treatment-outcome studies
and empirically validated treatment are several. Qualitative research may be
used to understand patient-client relationships and their impact on treatment,
patients’ experience of therapy, and how therapeutic lessons are or are not integrated into daily functioning. Perhaps interviews with patients might reveal
what they deemed important in treatment. Likewise, qualitative study of therapists’ experience delivering empirically supported treatments or their decision
making during this process would likely enhance our understanding of treatment implementation. There are many other places for qualitative research in
the examination and development of empirically supported treatment, some of
which can be found in the literature and journals exclusively publishing qualitative studies, such as in Qualitative Health Research, Qualitative Research, and
Qualitative Research in Psychology.
Compared with large-sample experimental group designs and small-scale
qualitative research studies, single-subject designs describe another important research methodology. Single-subject designs and case studies are useful venues
for studying the responses of individuals (or single collective groups of individuals) to assessment or treatment, and can provide valuable information toward
development or evaluation of treatment-outcome research. Case-based research is discussed later in this chapter. Although single-subject designs are
sometimes criticized for lack of generalization, there are benefits and reasons
for studying people individually.
Single-subject experimental designs, such as ABAB designs, multiplebaseline designs and changing criterion designs, maintain the same methodological rigor of experimental group designs. Research employing single-subject
methodology examines the causal effects of independent variables on dependent
variables, but looks at these relationships within one individual (or single group
or single society, referred to as a “single case” from this point forward) rather
than between groups of individuals exposed to different conditions. Instead, the
single case may be exposed to various conditions at different times (e.g., first, a
nutritional counseling program; second, an exercise regimen; third, a weight
management support group), or to the same conditions at various time points
(e.g., alternating 6 weeks of group weight management participation with 6
weeks of self-monitoring). The distinguishing characteristics of single-subject designs include continuous assessment and use of different phases.
Continuous assessment is defined as “observations on multiple occasions
over time prior to and during the period in which the intervention is administered” (Kazdin, 2003, p. 274). Continuous assessment usually includes a baseline assessment that describes the observations made about the independent and
dependent variables prior to any intervention or purposeful influence by the
researcher. Baseline assessment is critical to making predictions about what
might or might not occur as a result of introducing the independent variable(s).
Different phases refers to the “different periods of time (several days, weeks) in
which a particular condition (baseline or intervention) is implemented and
data are collected” (Kazdin, 2003, p. 274). Thus, the continuous monitoring
and evaluation of the independent and dependent variables allow critical
changes to be detected, and permit the researcher to distinguish whether the
changes in the dependent variables occurred subsequent to the introduction of
90 Introduction
the independent variables. The different phases allow for different interventions or independent variables to be introduced while being monitored, and
therefore, for cause and effect to be determined. In fact, if you are an empiricist
at heart, or have knowledge of cognitive-behavioral psychology, you might
begin to wonder how this methodology differs from best practice in applied
clinical psychology. Stay tuned for the answer to this question.
In ABAB designs, treatment and assessment are alternated to monitor
changes that occur in the dependent variable as a result of introducing or discontinuing an intervention. In multiple-baseline designs, several dependent
variables are monitored for an extended period before introducing treatments
or interventions and monitoring their impact. If a behavioral modification plan
is designed to stop child tantrums, the child’s behaviors in school, home, and
perhaps in the company of babysitters are monitored. The intervention might
first be introduced in one setting, while all three circumstances continue to be
monitored. The clinician or researcher continues to look for changes in the behaviors to see if the modification plan is directly impacting the behaviors. The
child may discontinue tantrums only in the environment where the plan is
in place, or perhaps the impact generalizes to other settings as well. In such
multiple-baseline designs, the intervention may be tested across settings, across
behaviors (so first tantrums are targeted, then aversive eating behavior, and finally perhaps an increase in prosocial behavior is monitored). In more complicated designs, multiple baseline designs can be tested across participants (see
Kazdin, 2003, pp. 283–285 for more details).
Changing criterion designs monitor exactly what is inferred. Relationships
between independent and dependent variables are studied, and the goal is to
show that “behavior changes in increments to match a performance criterion”
(Kazdin, 2003, p. 286). The independent variable, or treatment/intervention/consequence, continues to change (i.e., more/less reinforcement/punishment/consequence) after each goal is met (desired increase or decrease
in behavior is exhibited). While quantitative data is likely collected during
single-subject research, it is analyzed by visual inspection methods rather
than by statistical analyses.
The previous descriptions are oversimplified, and there are many other
single-subject designs. The goal here is to give you at least some sense of what
is described in research articles reviewing treatment efficacy or effectiveness
based on the single-subject designs. But, why use single-subject designs if interpretation is subject to visual inspection, and therefore to researcher bias?
Why use this methodology if the ability to generalize the findings to others is
possibly limited?
The benefits of single-subject designs are several. First, unique treatments,
characteristics, or conditions can be studied in single-subject designs, whereas
large N studies may not be feasible due to limited access to participants (by virtue
of incidence) or the cost of such implementation. An example might be a singlesubject design to study the impact of a new anger management therapy with hypertensive patients (Wilner, 2004). In this situation, known elements of different
cognitive-behavioral therapies were combined with close medical monitoring of
the patients’ blood pressure to evaluate if this type of therapy would be effective
in reducing anger, lowering blood pressure, increasing problem-solving skills,
Clinical Research and Outcome Assessment 91
and improving overall quality of life. Because aspects of this treatment were
tested empirically with other populations, modifications based on this sample’s
needs could be considered and close evaluation by the clinician and patients’
physicians allowed for fine-tuning the intervention based on individual needs.
The important concept here is that all other explanations for change in anger and
blood pressure could be ruled out and any changes could be attributed to the intervention. This is the essence of internal validity, and one of the key elements to
experimental designs. Once success is met on a small-scale study, and researchers can determine what elements of a treatment should be included,
added, or taken away, larger studies can be conducted more cost-effectively.
Thus, single-subject designs share some of the credibility of larger experimental
studies while allowing more specificity in addressing the issues at hand and can
serve as a precursor to larger studies.
Single-case studies are also important to study the implications of having
or treating rare conditions. It is likely less common to attract a large sample of
schizoaffective patients with panic disorder, diabetes with resulting nerve damage, and asthma to study the modification of an empirically validated treatment for panic disorder without comorbid difficulties. With both medical
conditions compromising relaxation treatment, and the psychological disorder
needing to be accounted for, empirically testing the results of thoughtful clinical decision making could be important to inform other clinicians of what
worked and did not work in such a situation. If such research is not conducted,
independent clinicians must continue to rely on trial and error, without systematically knowing what about the therapeutic interventions is helpful or not.
Further discussion of case-based research is provided later in this chapter.
The limitations of single-subject designs, even in the cases described here,
are significant and need to be carefully considered in deciding on the goal of research to be designed and implemented. Although cause and effect may be relatively clear in most of the designs and for the purposes described, single-subject
designs typically cannot distinguish what role the participant’s or the therapist’s
characteristics played in the outcome. So, if hypertensive patients benefited
from the newly designed cognitive-behavioral treatment, was it distinctly because of the treatment? Or, was there something about the energy level and dedication of the therapist, or the receptivity and motivation of the patient that
made the treatment particularly successful? These questions cannot be answered without replication of the studies with new therapists or patients, or in
larger group designs. Yet, many would argue that large group designs also require replication, since their results are based on averages of changes in dependent variables and individual changes are usually not reported.
Relevance of Single-Case Design
Earlier we posed the question, “How does single-subject research methodology
differ from best practices in applied clinical psychology?” It is now time for
your answer and a comparison of these two applications. Relevant to the practice of clinical psychology, the data collected and outcomes generated by this
family of single-subject designs are exactly the type of information sought by
behavioral health care agencies and insurance companies to justify payment for
92 Introduction
treatment, or verification of the outcome of therapy. Because the design of cognitive behavioral therapy relies on systematic and ongoing assessment, monitoring of progress, and follow-up on outcomes, it is often well accepted by
behavioral health care insurance companies for treatment of many common
problems. Later chapters illustrate methods of assessment and treatment that
could be used for therapy as well as in single-subject design research. The important difference between research and therapy, when a distinction needs to
be made, is that research aims to further knowledge about a particular phenomenon (intervention, condition, behavior), and therapy aims to advance the
well-being of an individual. Thus, the desired outcome in research is for the
greater good of psychological science and its consumers; the desired outcome
for therapy is for the better health of the individual and those directly affected
by him or her.
Case studies refer to “the intensive study of the individual” (Kazdin, 2003,
p. 267). As in single-subject designs, individual can refer to one person, one
group, one society, and so on. In contrast to single-subject designs, depending
on how case studies are operationally defined, they may not be methodologically rigorous, and are usually not based on quantitative data. Case study authors provide specific, detailed anecdotal and contextual information, and the
biases of the writer’s perspective or interpretations. Their goal often is to explicate the intricacies of a particular phenomenon, to reflect on the action taken
under specific circumstances or, perhaps, to illustrate the information leading
to the development of a theory. This description may sound similar to that of
the qualitative study, but qualitative designs require preplanned methodology,
are replicable, and are analyzed systematically, often by more than one individual, to achieve consensual validation. Thus, studies based on qualitative
methodology differ significantly from case studies, although they both rely on
narratives, detailed explication of constructs, and possibly qualitative analysis.
The relevance of case studies to clinical psychology is that often people
present with unique and unexplained behaviors, personality patterns, or coping styles that are not documented as disorders or common occurrences, and
best treatments for these individuals are not always evident. Case studies highlight individuality and the relative success (or lack thereof) of the approach
taken by the author. These anecdotes can be useful for contemplating the approach to a similar person. While single-subject designs require preplanned
methodology and prospective study, case studies, as defined here, are often
written retrospectively and are usually not replicable due to their unstructured
or unsystematic methods of information gathering and reporting. So, generalization and even the validity of the outcomes reviewed are often questioned
and sometimes questionable. Confusion in the literature can occur when case
studies are defined more broadly to include single-subject designs or other systematic methodology.
The value of case studies has been acknowledged widely in the clinical
psychology field. Some journals (e.g., Clinical Case Studies) are solely dedicated
to case studies, as are others to single-subject designs. Case studies can be
viewed as a jumping-off point for new ideas, hypotheses, theories, and political action (e.g., the anecdote of one person’s negative experience of ageism in
adoption might lead to further explanation of general practices and state leg-
Clinical Research and Outcome Assessment 93
islation on the issue, if relevant). Therapy techniques can be developed in response to recognizing unique phenomena that might have significant attributes relevant to a subset of a population or individuals sharing similar
characteristics. Kazdin (2003) also explains the value of case studies that
offer counterinstances, or examples of when a known and accepted therapy
does not work. Furthermore, Kazdin argues the motivational and persuasive
value of case studies as both a value, and as a stimulus for more systematic
and controlled research. Claims made that classical music played during exam
preparation enhanced an individual’s performance significantly from being a
“C” student to being an “A” student might be so compelling to readers that
some consumers will instantly invest in new music collections, whereas investigators (and production companies!) will jump to their computers to
write new research protocols to study the veracity of such claims using experimental designs. Thus, the persuasive ability might be somewhat concerning
when not critically examined (such as testimonials for fad diets), but the generation of more research helps to keep cause and effect, and scientific truth
and fallacy in balance.
Methods Summary
Research of any kind is not perfect. Researchers face the challenge of answering
their questions and examining their hypotheses under optimal circumstances
that allow cause and effect to be determined, and allow their results to be generalized to others. Sometimes this means that quantitative research is conducted with very selective population samples under highly controlled
environments, and sometimes this means selecting a diverse sample and examining their behaviors or responses to changes in the independent variables
(treatment) under conditions as similar to “normal” as possible. There is much
grey in between, and cultural considerations, replicability, feasibility, and the
goals of the research all need to be considered.
Qualitative studies allow more latitude because hypotheses are not clearly
formed at the outset, but rather, questions guide the studies’ development.
Concepts are expected to be expanded, and the results are not necessarily predictable. Single-subject research designs follow in the complexity of the experimental and quasi-experimental designs, and are further limited by the small
sample included. However, their return for answering research questions and
advancing treatment developments and modifications can be outstanding. Case
studies offer a unique contribution to treatment development in their nonmethodological approach to exploring new ideas and concepts in the context of
anecdotal reports of individual experiences. The advancement of clinical science and the expansion of empirically validated, empirically supported, and
manually driven therapies rely on the combination of the methodologies and
studies described so far in this chapter. As we turn to examine the range of
treatment options available for clinicians’ use, and how they are categorized,
studied, and disseminated, your understanding of the complexity of research
and methodologies should allow you to understand why the application of scientific techniques to the study of human behavior and behavioral change
(broadly defined—thoughts, feelings, actions) is so challenging.
94 Introduction
Therapeutic Interventions: Are They All the Same?
The 1990s saw health care reform through the management of care, and mental health professionals were called to task to justify their practices, services,
and outcomes. This has also been true of medical practitioners, but issues directly relating to medicine are not addressed here. Since clinical psychology
both thrives and suffers from grand diversity in theory and practice, the ambiguity of what constitutes “good therapy” highlighted many questions
and called for action from the field. When a field is as wide as mental health
care or even clinical psychology, bringing a profession to consensus is a difficult task.
Imagine you had to organize a discussion about therapeutic best practice
for treating a depressed young adult who has not been attending work for the
past 3 weeks. Your discussion group consists of three psychologists you knew
from your undergraduate training in a room with three of your graduate professors. Then you asked volunteers from yet a different theoretical prospective
to join the discussion. Would you gain agreement on steps to take? Maybe, but
it is more likely you would not. Now, offer the same group the opportunity to
design treatment for a personality-disordered adult. Would the consensus come
easily? It is highly unlikely that it would. Even with the most clear-cut diagnoses and problems, individual differences among the clients and the therapists
would cause variation in treatment plans. How, then, was the field to come to
an agreement on what to support in the face of external challenges? Surely
there was a need to rely on the research literature. Yet, research is more popular among some specialties of therapy (e.g., cognitive-behavioral therapy) than
others (e.g., long-term psychoanalysis), and therefore, even this approach was
likely to yield varying responses.
Empirically Supported and Probably Efficacious Treatments
To revert back to the beginning of the movement, the demands from thirdparty payers and the public spawned the development of a task force under Division 12 (Clinical Psychology) of the American Psychological Association and
the leadership of David Barlow. The purpose of the Task Force on Promotion
and Dissemination of Psychological Procedures was “to consider methods to educate clinical psychologists, third party payers and the public about effective
psychotherapies” (APA Division of Clinical Psychology, 1995, p. 3). The task
force delineated two categories of therapies, “Well-Established Treatments,”
and “Probably Efficacious Treatments.” The terms “empirically validated treatments” and “well-established treatments” are often used interchangeably.
Sometimes “empirically supported treatments” refers to the well-established
treatments, and sometimes to those in the probably efficacious group. The criteria for each of these categories are listed in Table 4.1. Note the inclusion and
roles of “experimental designs,” “case studies,” and “single-subject designs.”
The lists of treatments meeting the criteria outlined in Table 4.1 were established on the basis of empirical evidence published in peer-reviewed literature.
The 1995 list of well-established and probably efficacious treatment was ex-
Clinical Research and Outcome Assessment 95
panded to include additional treatment protocols in 1998 (see Table 4.2). Although the attempt to classify and list effective therapies was a noble starting
point, it was met with much controversy.
Cognitive-behavioral therapy as a paradigm and specialty in clinical psychology is known to be a short-term approach to therapy that is based on treatment manuals for techniques and agendas. Other long-term therapies that rely
more on process-oriented topics and analysis-based interactions are less
amenable to description in a manual and replication. Experimental and quasiexperimental designs, almost by definition, require manualized treatment and
operationally defined interventions to evaluate effectiveness. Without a manual, the independent variable in experimental designs would not be systematically delivered or measurable to determine its impact on the dependent
variable (patient change). Thus, cognitive-behavioral therapies were said to be
overrepresented in the lists of established and efficacious treatments, and other
therapies were not well represented (Levant, 2004).
Although the intention of the task force was to educate others about
existing therapies and their credits, perhaps the unintentional consequence
was that some therapies were assumed to be ineffective or not valid versus
not validated or lacking evidence because empirical evidence was not available. Third-party payers, laypersons, and perhaps some clinicians may have

96 Introduction
dichotomized existing therapies prematurely, setting unrealistic expectations
that all therapies must be categorized as empirically validated or empirically
unsupported. This dichotomy might restrict trade or consideration of available
treatments, which ultimately does not serve the best interests of scientific inquiry or service to the public.
A Closer Look at Manuals
So what is a manual exactly? Some people think of treatment manuals as cookbooks, and this is one of the biggest criticisms of the format. “If your client has
agoraphobia, turn to page 15 for instructions on what to do. Worried thoughts?
Please turn to page 21.” Therapy would sure be a lot easier if treatment decisions and implementation were so straightforward. Even the best manual cannot address all the nuances of individual differences, but manuals should
provide specific information about the parameters of the treatment. A manual
should indicate for whom the treatment is appropriate. Has research shown
that the treatment is more or less effective with a certain age or ethnic group?
Has it been tested with heterogeneous samples, or is that a recognized caution?
What should be done if the patient has comorbid psychological disorders? In
what sequence should the treatment be delivered? Is it contraindicated or acceptable if the client is also taking psychotropic medications or medications for
medical illnesses?
What are other useful ingredients in treatment manuals? Many manuals
contain session-by-session objectives, goals, and homework assignments. It is
helpful when manuals indicate what diagnostic criteria should be used to determine the emphasis of the treatment delivery. Scripts and handouts for clients
also help maximize reliability and transfer of information from the therapist to
clients. Handouts might include bulleted or expansive explanations of information discussed during a therapy session, worksheets to practice skills learned in
therapy, or record sheets that provide a format for between-session data collection by the client on thoughts, feelings, behaviors, interactions, or other information. Some manuals provide sample explanations therapists can use to
approach client issues, and others provide analogies or perhaps even mnemonics to aid in comprehension or retention of information for the patient. Troubleshooting guides, pertinent decision-making questions, and examples of how
treatments can be modified for nontraditional therapy settings, persons with
different characteristics than those who participated in validation of the manual, or perhaps, tips on how to modify treatment for delivery in a different
modality (e.g., group, couples) are all helpful sections that might be included.
With the use of technology, treatment manuals are also now incorporating
web-based information, online exercises, and other resources. Some manuals
include a compact disk with clinical forms that purchasers can use in their personal practice. The many benefits of manualized treatment seem obvious from
the description of their text. Just the time savings for creating patient handouts
and resource guides is a significant benefit.
If all the preceding information is provided in a manual, then you might
wonder why clients could not use such books as self-help tools. The truth is
that many self-help books include much of the same material as some treatment manuals. For a small subset of the mental health consumer population,
self-help books might be sufficient to change problematic thinking or behaviors. For many, however, lack of motivation, feelings of desperation, or the impairment the disorder has caused in home, work, or social environments is too
significant to be treated without professional help. Likewise, if treatment manuals are so inclusive and precise, why is there controversy in the field about
their use? Shouldn’t any professional be able to read a manual and deliver its
Clinical Research and Outcome Assessment 97
98 Introduction
contents effectively? Perhaps you have begun to identify some of the potential
criticisms of manualized treatments. The following discussion alerts you to
some of these possible limitations.
The Science in the Practice and the Practice of the Science
In reality, what we know from the literature is that the scientific validation of
therapies is still immature. Many therapies have not yet been tested, and those
that have been are tested with a restricted sample (those with pure diagnoses
and no comorbid diagnoses, which is actually atypical in mental health clients;
homogeneous groups lacking ethnic and cultural diversity) and often in artificial environments (university-based settings versus community-based clinics or
private practices). Given these limitations, the generalization of findings from
empirical studies is also restricted. This argument is not to discredit the scientific integrity of existing research on manualized treatments and techniques. It
is intended to highlight the limits of our knowledge about what works and
what does not work for specific disorders in persons with varying individual
characteristics, in varied settings, delivered by a wide range of therapists with
varying talents, characteristics, and abilities.
In fact, some research (Lambert & Barley, 2001, as cited by Levant, 2004)
suggests, “Specific techniques (namely, those that were the focus of the Division 12 Task Force report) accounted for no more than 15% of the variance in
therapy outcomes” (Levant, 2004, p. 221). More of the variance in therapy outcomes (as much as 30%) was explained by the characteristics and relationships
between therapists and clients (Levant, 2004) and factors common to all therapies (warmth, genuineness, positive regard), including helping patients to confront or face problems (Weinberger, 1995). These statistics resulted from the
Task Force on Empirically Supported Therapy Relationships, which was developed in 1999 by John Norcross, then president of Division 29 (Psychotherapy)
of the American Psychological Association.
So, if evidence indicates that therapy is generally effective, that some approaches are more effective than others but the difference explained is only approximately 15%, should treatment be restricted to empirically validated
protocols or manual-based therapies from the Division 12 task force list? Thirdparty payers would certainly have an easier time deciding what is valid for reimbursement if therapy decision making was that simple. However, Reisner
(2005) astutely points out, “Much can be said for actuarial decision making,
(but) it is the therapist who decides, moment to moment, when to talk and
when to listen, what technique to use and why, and as Linehan (1993) discusses, when to accept and when to encourage change. A technique or set of
techniques cannot substitute for a therapist’s judgment or make the therapist
more empathic or caring” (p. 10 of online version).
Treatment manuals cannot teach therapists how to think, when to challenge a client, or when to gently sit back and observe the interpersonal dynamics of the session as the therapy unfolds. Therapists’ styles vary greatly, as they
probably should. Thus, use of humor may be appropriate and effective for one
therapist-client dyad at a given moment, and not for another dyad or at another
juncture. Manuals cannot adequately teach clinicians how to engage in the
Clinical Research and Outcome Assessment 99
common factors of treatment, or convey the importance of implementing the
strategies of the manual in a common factors context.
The combination of best practice techniques, clinical skills and judgment,
and therapist’s characteristics are critical elements in successful therapy. Some
of these ingredients can be manualized and taught systematically, others cannot. Many therapies have been tested by randomized clinical trials and experimental designs, and many therapies have yet to be evaluated in this way. The
field has recognized that only a subset of therapies for a subset of disorders has
been examined in these ways. This does not mean that only these therapies are
empirically valid for use, or that randomized clinical trials are the only way to
evaluate therapies. From these realizations evolved the application of the medical terminology, “evidence-based medicine” to that of psychological treatments
and practice.
Evidence-Based Practice and Case-Based Research
In the beginning of this chapter, the argument was made that multiple research
designs contribute to the advancement of clinical psychology through developing and evaluating treatment options. Scholars (Edwards, Dattilio, & Bromley,
2004) promulgating a holistic model of the development of clinical knowledge
illustrate how practitioners’, scholars’, and researchers’ work interface for the
development of theory, treatment, randomized clinical trials (RCTs), and empirical tests of these treatments, and case-based refinement of empirically supported treatments. Evidence-based practice results from consideration and
integration of these knowledge sources. Therefore, evidence-based practice is
more than just the use of empirically supported treatments. Sackett, Rosenberg, Gray, Haynes, and Richardson (1996) define evidence-based practice as,
“the conscientious, explicit and judicious use of current best evidence in making decisions about the care of individual patients, [which] means integrating
individual clinical expertise with the best available external clinical evidence
from systematic research” (p. 71). According to Edwards et al. (2004), this requires consideration of experimental literature and case-based research.
Edwards et al. (2004) assert that clinical practice and science are “partners” (p. 590) in the development of clinical knowledge. According to their
model, clinical practice includes case-based clinical observations, supervision,
and professional discussion based on theoretical principles and science, and it
results in refinement of clinical theory, development of constructs and hypotheses, and new science. Sharing case-based observations through case conferences and publications is encouraged so that other perspectives can be
openly solicited. Case-based research in this model is broadly defined to include
single-subject designs that use qualitative or quantitative strategies, generated
prospectively or retrospectively. Numerous case-based observations together
may lead to development of new clinical treatment models. These can then lead
to treatment manuals to be tested in RCTs that, in turn, allow clinical treatment
models to be scrutinized according to scientific principles and research methodology, and often yield additional experimental studies. According to this model,
the studies inform or challenge applied clinical theory, which, in turn, should
influence and inform clinical practice. What develops from these reciprocal
interactions is “evidence-based medicine” and advancement of clinical psychology knowledge. Edwards and colleagues appear to have resurrected and applied
the defined “scientist-practitioner model” of training to the actual science and
practice of clinical psychology. Their connection of the subfields of clinical psychology is masterful in helping readers understand how the pieces of the clinical psychology jigsaw puzzle may fit together.
As you are discovering your niche in clinical psychology and are beginning to ground yourself in a pattern of thought about your potential role in the
field, the discussion of evidence-based medicine and case-based research might
seem obvious and simple. Certainly, the model seems clear, so perhaps the controversial aspects of this model are not. If this is where you find yourself, take a
moment and enjoy your perspective.
Many researchers argue against the proposed model or those similar to it,
because of all the arguments provided earlier in the chapter against case studies and single-subject designs. However, those in favor of case-based research,
and those who appreciate that theory can be grounded (Strauss & Corbin,
1994) or steeped in case example, also suggest that operational definitions can
be developed and generalizations can be made from a compilation of casebased data. Some argue that researchers undervalue case-based data and tend
to minimize the significant problems associated with RCTs and experimental
designs. After all, the data generated by experimental study of clinical therapies
is often based on self-report results of pencil-and-paper instruments that have
widely varying degrees of reliability and construct validity. In fact, the instruments used to obtain the data provide a another whole source of bias, restriction of information, and error. But that story is for another day.
These arguments can give you a flavor of the challenges that face clinical
psychology in today’s search for best treatment practices. There is plenty
of material in the literature that criticizes or defends case-based research or
that criticizes or defends experimental designs, RCTs, and quantitative research
strategies. Perhaps we should be mindful of Edwards et al.’s (2004) quote
of Kiesler’s (1981, p. 213) work stating, “all research is flawed . . . scientific
progress results from repeated empirical attacks on a problem . . . no single
study . . . is worth much in and of itself.”
Summary
Many educators, scientists, and clinicians would agree that we should not throw
out the baby with the bathwater. Efforts to empirically validate the methods
used in psychotherapy are critical to the advancement, acceptance, and development of the field of clinical psychology, but they do not provide the total answer. Likewise, clinical practice, experience, and consideration of individual

You may have heard, “Everyone can profit from therapy,” or “Everyone
needs psychotherapy.” Neither of these is correct. Not everyone needs
psychotherapy nor can everyone profit from the experience. What then makes
a person decide to become a patient or client? Who actually might need therapy? In this chapter, we explore the reasons a person seeks or gets referred for
psychotherapy.
Learning Objectives
At the end of this chapter, the reader should be able to:
• List the 12 most common reasons that people seek psychological help.
• Explain at least four differences between normal and abnormal behavior.
• Describe the multiaxial diagnostic systems of DSM-IV-TR and ICD-10.
• Discuss how psychopathology and functional behavior are connected.
• Identify disorders that are usually first diagnosed in childhood.
• Describe the difference between major symptomatic disorders and personality disorders.
Edward was very worried about germs and possible contamination. When
he washed his hands (which he did several times a day), he washed with a stiff
scrub brush and a special germicidal soap. He would wet his hands, soap them,
scrub them, rinse them and then soap, scrub, and rinse several more times.
Alice was always scanning for danger. She rarely saw anything dangerous,
but she was always on her guard. She looked at people’s faces for some hint of
104 Introduction
danger. She would scrutinize their bodies without any sexual interest, looking
for hidden weapons. She watched for body language that might signal the person was a terrorist.
Tim appreciated his job. He worked alone, lived alone, and only saw other
people about once every 3 months when he had to deal with them to restock
his pantry. He preferred his books, classical music CDs, and online activity.
Sonia loved attention. She bought outlandish outfits knowing that this
attire would make everyone stare at her. At one point, it was a skimpy bathing
suit that was so daring, everyone was startled when she wore it. At other
times, she wore outfits that covered her body from head to toe in a garish mix
of colors.
Eric was a perfectionist. He did not accept “close” to perfection as an acceptable conclusion of any task. He believed that he could not just be near the
mark, but must always be right on the mark. He demanded of himself and others that perfection was the only acceptable goal.
None of these people came for therapy, at least not for the preceding behavioral patterns. None of these people saw the need to change what they did.
Edward was a surgeon, Tim was the caretaker of a lighthouse, Alice was in
charge of airport security at a large metropolitan airport, Sonia was an actress,
and Eric was a neurosurgeon.
Understanding Why People Become Patients
At least 12 common D-words describe the reasons people seek therapy. These
include the individual, family, or couple being Discomforted, Discontented,
Distressed, Disabled, Dysfunctional, Disconnected, Dispirited, Disorganized, Distraught, Dissatisfied, Dyscontrolled, and Disgusted. All these descriptive terms
refer to mood states that are unpleasant and perhaps frightening to the person
experiencing the mood and possibly to those around him or her. Not only is the
mood or affective state an inherently aversive experience, these states can preclude or interfere with other moods and interactions that would be more beneficial. Imagine that you are thinking about going to a party, but you feel generally
dispirited and disconnected. Perhaps you will find just the antidote to those feelings at the social function. Or it may be that you scarcely notice who or what is
going on around you because of your negative preoccupation. As a result, you interact poorly and tend to turn others away. Others mutter about your “weird” attitude and behavior. When “D-word” moods are prolonged, the impact on a
person’s general functioning and quality of life and health can be enormous.
Describing Normal versus Abnormal Behavior
The operational definitions of normal and abnormal may be a function of time,
culture, geography, or style. If one were to wear an exceptionally brief bathing
suit, it might be viewed appreciatively on the French Riviera, but would be unacceptable in another country. In some groups, wearing a garment that exposes
Why People Become Patients 105
any part of the body would be considered inappropriate or even illegal. A
bathing suit that would be acceptable according to today’s standards might have
gotten someone arrested 40 years ago at the very same beach.
Speaking in tongues, seizure-like body movements, and drooling might be
labeled as abnormal in one setting and as religious fervor in another. Is the correct interpretation of this behavior religious rapture, psychological decompensation, or neurological problems? Although an operational definition for
abnormal is essential to understanding psychopathology, we must admit from
the beginning that we are stuck. There are a multitude of definitions that are
based in culture, philosophy, religion, or politics. Szasz (1984, 1988, 1997) saw
the term and the construct of mental illness as a way for society to control its
members. Those who did not conform to the demands and expectations of the
dominant society were seen as mentally ill. Probably the best example of
Szasz’s idea would be in countries that see their political system as perfect and
unassailable despite visible and contrary data. Anyone, therefore, who is dissident to their country’s “perfect system” must be (by definition) mentally ill.
They would then need to be immediately placed in a secure psychiatric facility
to have their “illness” treated.
We have come a long way from assessing people as being possessed by
demons to explain their behavior. We recognize biological, sociological, and
psychological reasons for behavior that deviates from the societal norm. None
of these explanatory models can offer a total answer. As is often the case, numerous combinations and permutations of factors explain behavior. Behavior
may be caused or influenced by biogenetic factors, the genotype. The observed
behavior is identified as the phenotype. There may be environmental and social
factors that impact and impinge on the individual, the sociotype.
Problems emerge when a person’s behavior noticeably interferes with
what they are trying to do. What gets noticed in one setting may be easily and
quickly overlooked in another. One of the caveats that we offer in any discussion of psychopathology is that there may not be a single standard that transcends all people, at all times, in all circumstances. With every individual, we
have to take great care to evaluate that individual’s strengths, coping abilities,
and personal attributes, in addition to problems and problem areas.
It is negative behavior, or behavior that has a negative outcome, that most
often brings someone into psychotherapy. Simply, the behavior is causing problems both within the person and with others. Individuals who are very dependent may gather people around them who provide care. They may not perceive
this as a problem nor would they see depending on others as negative. If, however, they lose their support system for any reason, then their dependence may
have a negative effect because they feel abandoned. Individuals often come
with the complaint that they need to get their lives together, get their head together, or take control of their life.
Among the most important diagnostic factors is the ability of the individual to develop and use a broad range of actions and reactions. Over time, each
of us develops and maintains a repertoire of reactions to various internal and
external stimuli. The person with a limited repertoire of behaviors is more
likely to have a difficulty that triggers one of the 12 D-word moods. They try to
use the same responses in most situations no matter whether the responses fit.
106 Introduction
If life for an individual is very limited and tightly controlled, this may not be a
problem. For example, in the military, what one wore (a uniform), how one
wore it, when one wore it, and the proper care of that uniform would be set
out by rules, custom, and regulations. A person with a limited repertoire may
be very adaptive as long as the situation remains the same. When life changes,
or when circumstances demand a greater variety of responses the same person
may not effectively cope.
Kenneth, aged 66, sought therapy because of his depression. He reported
that he had been depressed for most of his life. On several occasions, he had
sought therapy and after varying amounts of time, had terminated it when he
felt less depressed. When questioned by his current therapist as to whether he
had ever been happy, he quickly replied, “Yes, when I was drafted into the
army at age 18. I was sent to Europe in 1958. It was wonderful!” When asked
what made it wonderful, Ken replied, “It was so easy to live there. I never had
to worry about what to wear, what to do, where to eat, what to eat, where to
live, or even when to get up and when to sleep. It was the perfect life.” When
asked if it was always like that, Ken replied, “No. There was a time when several of us were told to go to a town in Germany to help build a school. We were
told to wear civvies so as not to stand out too much. I hated that. We lived in a
local hotel and ate at various restaurants. I never knew what to wear or what to
order. The other guys made fun of me because I wore the same thing every
day.” Ken had limited internal resources.
Some individuals might have perceived Ken’s assignment as wonderful.
For some, living at a hotel as opposed to a barracks was heaven. Having a private room and bath as opposed to community living and latrines was wonderful. They could eat at any restaurant and choose their meals without having to
pay for them as opposed to eating in a mess hall. For Ken, this was torture and
he could not wait to return to his unit and to the army regimen. Because of a
limited repertoire of different choices and actions, his behavior became ritualized and compulsive. Even when his actions did not produce the desired results, he continued to act in the same way. He would even complain about how
he longed to return to the unit, which his buddies simply did not understand.
Related to the compulsive nature of such behavior is that these individuals are inflexible in dealing with problems and with people. When invited to
try a different approach to coping with problems, their likely response is that
they have always done it in the same way and are reluctant or insistent that
they should not have to change what they do. Again, even when their approach
does not work, they maintain the same inflexible approach.
On returning to civilian life, Ken studied electrical engineering, and over
the years he was moderately successful. His work was not conceptual or innovative. Rather, it involved technical production of models designed by others.
Being told what to do was what he wanted. Did this style contribute to his depression? Or, was the major factor in his depression the reality that the world
cannot always be regular and predictable?
For other individuals, the difficulty stems from their manner of approaching interpersonal or intrapersonal difficulties. Their approach to problem solving may be described as “thoughtless.” By thoughtless, we do not mean that
they cannot or do not think or that they are necessarily cognitively challenged.
Why People Become Patients 107
Rather, their behavioral responses appear to be “automatic.” Essentially, their
lives operate in a stimulus-to-response mode. Having always responded in
a particular manner, they continue to do so, even if the situation warrants a
different response. They do not seem to make choices but try to make one size
fit all.
Lisa had always been shy. She avoided situations where she would be the
center of attention. She had always managed to remain in the background in
classes and now at her work. When offered a promotion with a sizable salary
increase, Lisa was torn. Should she accept it or stay “safe” in the background.
Her life circumstances required that she earn more money to help pay for her
mother’s medical care. She accepted the position, but after 3 weeks was called
into her supervisor’s office and told that she could not keep her office door
closed and communicate with her staff via e-mail. She had to have weekly
staff meetings, and interact with her staff. The ensuing anxiety brought Lisa to
seek therapy.
For some individuals, their actions are often so noticeable to others that
the individual gets marked and colored by their own behavior. Probably the
simplest example is driving according to the speed limit. Many people accept as
a fact that driving no more than 5 miles over the posted speed limit is okay. By
what authority is this okay? Has anyone ever seen in writing, a rule that says
any driver can exceed the speed limit by 5 miles without penalty? Likely not!
The myth comes from the personal experience we have all had of driving 5
miles over the posted speed without repercussions. However, if we drive 10 or
more miles over the speed limit and pass all those driving only 5 miles over the
speed limit, we are more noticeable. Subsequent to being noticed, we may face
censure, anger, retribution, and revenge. We may, in fact, be forced to pay a
fine by the agents of our society, the criminal justice system.
This leads to the next factor, the individual’s behaviors, thoughts, and feelings being extreme. What is most likely seen as “normal” is behavior, thoughts,
and feelings that tend to be moderate. It is wonderful to feel good, but it can
become euphoria that leads to dangerous actions.
Susan, aged 20, sought therapy because of her anxiety. She announced to
the therapist that she wanted to be cured of her anxiety. She reported that it
kept her from sleeping, interfered with her school performance, negatively impacted her social life, and made relating to peers difficult. The problem with
trying to rid Susan of all her anxiety was that it might leave her amotivational.
Too little anxiety and there may not be motivation to study. Too much anxiety
could interfere with studying and with memory. Ideally, to become normal,
Susan would move her anxiety from the extreme to a more moderate point.
There will always be people at the extremes of the normal curve. The majority
of individuals are between −1 and +1 standard deviations.
The issue of adaptation is another key concept. How adaptive are people to
their environment and situation? The person who seeks clinical services is
more likely to experience some form of maladaptive behavior. Sometimes actions or thoughts that worked at some earlier point in life stop working or the
new situation calls for a shift in thinking, action, or affect. Using Piaget’s idea,
adaptation is an interaction between assimilation and accommodation. Assimilation refers to the incorporation of new information into existing schemas
108 Introduction
(using old schemas in new situations). This helps to give the world some predictability and context. Accommodation involves the alteration of an old
schema to account for new information. This allows an expanded understanding of the world.
Another problem may emerge when individuals are in tune with a small
subpart of the larger community. They may have no problems as long as they
stay in their small community. It is when they are at odds with the larger community that they come to our attention. The subculture may be the family, the
neighborhood, the town, or the local community. Children who have been reinforced for not speaking and for using hand signals and grunts at home to get
what they desire will not be treated the same way once they go to school, but
will be expected to speak and participate in the life of the class.
Paul was born and raised in a small ethnic enclave in a large eastern city.
He spoke his parents’ native language at home and with his friends and neighbors. He went to a parochial school in his neighborhood and attended his local
parish church which was also an ethnic church. After graduating from high
school, he went to a state college at some distance from his home. He chose the
college because of its excellent program in his area of interest. After one term,
he was so upset and unhappy that he left the school, and later he enrolled in a
small college near his home. Although it did not have the program that he
wanted, he stayed through to graduation and chose another area of specialization because he felt comfortable with the culture of the smaller college.
Large parts of maladaptive patterns may be self-consonant. That is, these
individuals may not see their behavior as abnormal. They may see their problem
as the ill will or negative behaviors of others. Their sentences often begin with,
“If only they . . .” People who see their behavior as reasonable and appropriate,
despite evidence to the contrary, will not only avoid therapy, but may have
great difficulty when forced to be involved in therapy.
Evan was a tenured college professor who had earned a doctorate in history from a prestigious university. He was infamous among the students for his
veiled sexist comments and innuendos in his classes. Many colleagues, male
and female, had asked him to be careful with his comments inasmuch as they
could be taken as harassment. After he made a particularly egregious comment, his behavior was finally reported and a grievance was filed. He denied
any negative intent and tried to dismiss the grievance as the product of “poor
sports,” “people without a sense of humor,” or the college administration pandering to the “God of political correctness.” After an investigation, he was
placed on administrative leave and told that he would have to participate in
several months of weekly one-on-one sexual harassment counseling. At the
end of that time, the counselor would report back on the result of the counseling. After the counseling was completed, the counselor reported that in every
session, Evan insisted that he had done nothing wrong, that he was unfairly
being singled out for punishment by a “radical, lesbian, feminist cabal” at the
college. He was fired for cause, and after some legal interaction, left the college.
The final two pieces relate to the areas of concern or conflict. The interpersonal issues are those issues that affect others. For the sake of our discussion, we can group problems into interpersonal (between the individual and
those in that individual’s surroundings) and intrapersonal (problems that are
troubling for the individual). There is a bidirectional influence between the in-
Why People Become Patients 109
terpersonal and intrapersonal domains. If an individual who experiences depression may be sad and filled with self-loathing (“I’m worthless. I would be
better off dead.”), this depression may also influence others in the family (“I
hate to be with you when you’re like this. I feel so helpless to do anything.”).
Some of the intrapersonal issues are experiences such as being discomforted by feelings, thoughts, or experience (“I try to avoid driving over bridges.
I can do it if there is no other way, but I would drive 10 miles out of my way to
avoid driving across a bridge.”). We may feel discontented. We view our lives or
experience and ask, “Is this all that there is?” We may be distressed by internal
or external stimuli (“I am lost since my girlfriend left me. I wander around with
no direction.”).
When the experience is severe, we may become disabled. This might be
seen in an individual’s functioning decreasing to a point of no apparent function (“I just cannot get out of bed. I lie there for hours.”). This is both quantitatively and qualitatively different from the intrapersonal experience of being
dysfunctional where the individual’s usual level of function is decreased (“I just
have to push myself to get anything done. I get it done, but it is so hard.”).
Sometimes the intrapersonal issue is feeling disconnected from people and
experiences that surround us. (“I was at the party and people were trying to be
friendly but it felt as if I had a wall up.”). At times, we may feel dispirited. (“I
try and try to do well but nothing that I try seems to work.”). We may experience danger and great anguish and feel distressed (“I just know that some great
calamity will fall on me.”). When we cannot figure out what direction to go in,
or when we are doubtful about what to do, we may feel distraught (“What shall
I do? I can’t stay, and I can’t go, I’m stuck in the middle.”). There are times that
we are dissatisfied with our present experience. (“I want more!”), or disgusted
with the actions of others or the turn of affairs (I can’t stand her; this just
makes me sick!). When we do things that we know are negative and for which
we will pay a price, we may be dyscontrolled (“I know that the drinking is no
good for me but once I start, I can’t stop.”). Finally, we may be disorganized
(“Everything that I need to do is spread across six continents, and I can’t seem
to get my act together.”).
These mood experiences are more the norm than the exception. We have
all had these moods in some form, at some time, for some duration, with some
impact. Again, we need to delineate between those problems that are part of
living and development and those that bring someone to the attention of the
medico-legal system. Specifically, what will bring that individual in to see a
clinical psychologist?
Biological Perspectives
In what seems to us in the twenty-first century to be a rather quaint and interesting idea, the phrenologists of the eighteenth century “discovered” that certain attributes of personality or general functioning could be localized in the
brain. The more that a particular faculty was exercised, it would, like a muscle,
grow and show up as it pressed against the skull to raise bumps. Similarly, an
underused faculty would atrophy and result in a depressed area of the skull.
For example, reach back to the base of your skull. Is there a bump or a depressed area? This is the area identified by phrenologists as “amativeness.” If
110 Introduction
you have a large bump in this area you can be phrenologically certain that you
are high on amativeness. Or, possibly low on that faculty. Contemporary terminology labels amativeness as sexuality, defined as attraction to and attractiveness to others for sexual purposes. You might want to assess that again.
The biological view looks at brain function in terms of brain structures,
brain circuitry, and brain chemistry. The interaction of the brain with the endocrine system, the autonomic nervous system, the sensory input systems, the
muscles, digestive tract, and respiratory system is well known to us. Terms
such as “nervous stomach,” “a case of nerves,” “heartache,” “butterflies in the
stomach,” or “nervous twitch” are familiar to us. We understand these descriptive metaphors for the effect of emotion and cognition on our bodies. A cognitive therapist may ask about the thoughts in your head, a Gestalt therapist
might ask for the feelings in your heart. The emotions are, however, more related to the hypothalamus, the cortex, and the limbic system. The amygdala,
part of the limbic system, serves the function of evaluating a stimulus for its
emotional valence.
The frontal lobes of the cortex control abstract thought, focus of attention,
the ability to plan and sequence behaviors, and social adjustment, and some aspects of personality. Individuals who sustain frontal lobe damage may have
great difficulty in controlling their verbal or motor behavior, possibly being aggressive with very slight provocation. Postinjury, previously shy and inhibited
individuals may become grandiose and inappropriate. Previously reluctant or
unable to step forward, they now may demand center stage. They may say socially inappropriate things, tell off-color jokes, and generally have a personality
change. This change is not reversible, and the social controls that were previously coded and controlled by the frontal lobes seem to be turned off.
The technique of prefrontal lobotomy was once used as a means of controlling behavior. This involved cutting the connection between the right and
left frontal lobes. The desired reaction was to make excited and out-of-control
patients less excitable and more easily controlled. The result of calming was not
always achieved and what occurred more often was a “flattening” of the emotions. This technique is rarely used today for controlling behavior, though it has
been used for seizure activity that cannot be controlled by medication.
Similarly, individuals with damage to the temporal lobes of the cortex
that result in uncontrolled electrical output that we label as seizures may act in
antisocial ways, without recognition or memory of the acts.
“What a rush! We were doing 95 miles per hour, and the road was clear
and straight. It was incredible!” The rush that we experience is a rush of adrenaline. This hormone released by the adrenal glands pours into the bloodstream
and causes a release of glycogen (energy material), and increase in respiration
(increased oxygen for metabolism), an increase in heart rate (to get the glycogen and oxygen around the body as quickly as possible). Again, our emotional
state can be both caused by and cause an emotional interpretation.
Sociological Perspectives
It is extremely rare that anyone lives in a social vacuum. We live within the
social contexts and communities of family, church, school, and peers. Each
context overlaps and interacts with others, to a greater or lesser degree. We
Why People Become Patients 111
act on social context, and that context forms the myriad social schema that direct our behavior. It is not within the framework of this text to fully describe
and discuss these social issues. (For a broader explication of this issue, the
reader is referred to the following texts: Bowers, 2000; Brugha, 1995; Cockersham, 1999; Dubin & Fink, 1992; Horvitz & Scheid, 1999; and Tausig,
Michello, & Subedi, 2003). We know that the social context that a person lives
within can both pressure and support individuals and families. Social disorganization and community breakdown undoubtedly play a significant role in
the development and exacerbation of abnormal or disturbed behavior. Moving
to a new town, a new region of the country, or to a different country can significantly impact how someone feels and how those feelings are interpreted by
the community. Even within a broad community, views of behavior may differ broadly. For example, the Jones brothers, Jim and Joe, go to a local pub
every night for a few beers. They are also known for their loud and raucous
discussions regarding such esoteric topics as, “Who was the best quarterback
in history?” or “What third baseman had the highest batting average of all
time?”. More often than not, the discussions end in a wresting match and an
occasional bloody nose. Regular customers at the pub have learned to ignore
the Jones brothers and step over their wresting bodies. After the wresting,
they usually take time for another beer. However, the Jones brothers were invited to a wedding in an elegant hotel and were arrested when their wrestling
was deemed inappropriate.
Societies often place a stigma on those whose behavior is deviant or
aberrant from the larger group (even our use of terms like deviant, and aberrant are stigmatizing). Dubin and Fink (1992) state, “Mental illness was once
thought to be related to being possessed by demons. In more recent times
such concepts are no longer prevalent. Patients with mental disorders continue to be viewed as constitutionally weak, dangerous, and responsible for
their own plight” (p. 1).
In the classic 1957 musical, West Side Story (written for the stage by Arthur
Laurents and which became a film in 1961), the lyrics to “Gee, Officer Krupke”
(music by Leonard Bernstein and words by Stephen Sondheim) describe the
various problems that might lead to the delinquent behavior of a gang member
and how different societal spokespersons react to this adolescent behavior. (The
song is sung by gang members to the police officer on the beat, Sergeant
Krupke.) The gang members variously blame: parental use of drugs and alcohol, lack of love by parents, child abuse, family member’s gender confusion,
deprivation of love and material possessions at home, parental spousal abuse,
lack of work and career opportunities, and political factors.
Added to this are the views of various mental health professionals, for example, a psychoanalyst views them as needing a career, a social worker believes
that incarceration would be best along with vocational training, and a judge
views the adolescents as deprived. Society’s message to the adolescents is
stated in the conclusion of the song:
We’re no good!
We’re no good!
We’re no earthly good!
Like the best of us is no damn good!
112 Introduction
Social disorganization and community breakdown undoubtedly play a
significant role in the development and exacerbation of abnormal or disturbed
behavior. Although it is beyond the scope of this chapter to offer a review of
community factors, we need to acknowledge the vast impact of social and community stress as well as the mediating effects of social and community support.
Psychological Perspectives
The psychological perspective on normal behavior is rooted in theoretical models of personality. The psychodynamic perspective may differ markedly from
the behavioral perspective which may differ markedly from a Jungian position.
Rather than try to recapitulate a lecture in personality theory, we can say that
the psychological perspective comes from the way in which the individual
processes the stimulus cues, both internal and external. If you were walking
down the street and saw a very huge dog sitting in the middle of the sidewalk
with its lips drawn back in a snarl, what would you do? If you are a trained animal handler you might react by continuing on your way speaking softly and
calmly to the dog. If you were frightened of animals you might run away. A
simplified description of your reaction could be summarized by the following
equation: Risk versus Resources equals Response. Risk is your perception of the
danger to you. Resources are your perception of your abilities to adaptively
cope with the perceived risk. Your response is a product of that ratio.
Are our reactions a result of deeply held beliefs? Probably so! Are these
beliefs hidden away in the dark recesses of our unconscious? Maybe so! Are we
destined to repeat the mistakes of the past unless and until we resolve the conflicts and drives that spur our action? Probably not! Why the lack of certainty?
There are ideas, thoughts, beliefs, needs, expectations, attributions, and explanations that are not easily available to awareness. We simply do not think of
them. They may still have an active role in why we do what we do, what maintains our behavior, and how we can change what we do. For example, why are
we depressed? One psychological perspective is that it relates to how we view
ourselves, our world, and what we predict to be the future effect (cognitive behavioral view). Another widely accepted perspective is that it relates to experiences and perceptions of loss of love objects (object relations view).
The essence of the psychological perspective on why people become patients is that we all experience a series of life events from which we derive
some meaning that subsequently influences our thoughts, actions, and feelings.
This meaning, however it is derived, can precipitate any of the D-Word states
that trigger the quest for therapeutic intervention.
Patients versus Clients
The terminology to denote a person seeking or being part of a psychotherapeutic collaboration has shifted with the political winds. Is the person in therapy
properly termed a patient, a client, or a consumer? Are there differences or is it
a matter of “a rose by any other name would smell as sweet”? Terms in vogue
to describe an individual seeking or involved with mental health services include “patient,” “client,” “customer,” “survivor,” and “consumer.”
Why People Become Patients 113
There have been many concerns about referring to an individual as a patient because doing so places that individual in a “sick,” or “disabled,” role
(Sharma, Whitney, Kazarian, & Manchanda, 2000). A study by Meuser, Glynn,
Corrigan, and Baber (1996) suggested that no single term was preferred by the
users of mental health services. Of their study population, 45% preferred the
term “client,” 20% preferred the term “patient,” 8% preferred the term “consumer,” and 27% either had no preference or preferred another term. In a
replication of the Meuser et al. study, Sharma et al. (2000), found that among
providers of mental health services, 68.4% preferred the term “patient,” 26.5%
preferred the term “client,” and .5% preferred the term “consumer.” Among
service recipients, 54.8% preferred the term “patient,” 28.8% preferred the
term “client,” 7% preferred the term “survivor,” and 2.8% preferred the term
“consumer.” What is clear from these studies is that there is no clear preference
for terms used by providers or recipients of mental health services. The conclusion of both studies is that there is a need for an early, frank discussion between therapists and their “service recipients.”
Specific Types of Problems
People who are anxious or depressed will likely try different remedies in their
attempt to feel better. Some of them sleep, some shop, some incessantly talk on
the telephone. Some will try to feed their troubles and make them go away with
double-fudge rocky road mocha ice cream. Other people will avoid the obvious,
seeking their answers in cyberspace, and still others will use drugs or alcohol to
relieve the pain or discomfort. When and if these “solutions” stop working,
there are problems. Even if the “solutions” work to reduce the upset or depression, the solutions may become the new problem.
Codifying Psychopathology
Over the years, there have been many attempts to develop and maintain a standard coding system for mental problems. The two systems that are used are the
system developed by the World Health Organization entitled the International
Classification of Disease (ICD), and the system developed by the American Psychiatric Association entitled the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders
(DSM). Presently, ICD is in its tenth edition (ICD-10, 1997), and the DSM is in its
fourth edition, having recently published an edition that revised much of the
descriptive text (DSM-IV-TR, 2000).
DSM is used as the convention in the United States and several countries
around the world. ICD is more widely distributed and used in many countries
throughout the world. When the two are compared, there are many similarities
but also several differences. These differences appear in the terms and titles
used for disorders and also for some of the criteria.
In the “bad old days” of the diagnosis of psychological problems, it was
both easier and harder to diagnose a person’s problem(s). It was easier because
there were no clear rules, criteria, or terms. Clinicians could “mix and match”
114 Introduction
theoretical, descriptive, and diagnostic terms. It was harder because there were
no clear rules, criteria, or terms. Clinicians could easily make up their own diagnoses, mix and match terms, and not easily communicate their diagnosis to
another clinician. DSM-I (1952) states, “There resulted a polyglot of diagnostic
labels and systems, effectively blocking communication and the collection of
medical statistics” (p. v). The New York Academy of Medicine sponsored a conference in March, 1928 that developed a trial edition of a standard nomenclature that was published in 1932. By 1948 the system was in turmoil inasmuch
as the Armed Forces, the Veterans Administration, and the civilian standards
were different. Not substantively so, but different enough that a patient going
from the Army to the VA and then to a civilian hospital might carry different
labels.
In 1948, The World Health Organization published the International Statistical Classification of Diseases, Injuries, and Causes of Death in two volumes. This included not only psychiatric disorders, but all medical disorders. For all
classification systems, the ability to record, code, and classify disorders into set
categories was important for studying prevalence of the manifestation of the
disorder across groups.
In DSM-I (1952), all mental disorders were divided into two major groups:
1. Those in which there is a disturbance of mental function resulting from,
or precipitated by, a primary impairment of the function of the brain, generally due to a diffuse impairment of brain tissue; and
2. Those which are the result of a more general difficulty in adaptation of
the individual, and in which any associated brain function disturbance is
secondary to the psychiatric disorder (p. 9).
DSM-I covered the definition of terms for all disorders in 31 pages
(pp. 12–43). DSM-II (1968) was published as a collaborative effort with WHO,
which had published the eighth edition of ICD. By 1968, the definition of terms
was 38 pages in length. DSM-II offered greater specificity and attempted to clarify some basic concepts. As a point of comparison, we can examine the DSM-I
diagnosis termed “Sociopathic Personality Disturbance.” Individuals in this category were described as, “ill primarily in terms of society and of conformity
with the prevailing social milieu, and not only in terms of personal discomfort
and relations with other individuals. However, sociopathic reactions are very
often symptomatic of severe underlying personality disorder, neurosis, or psychosis, or occur as the result of organic brain injury or disease. Before a definitive diagnosis in this group is employed, strict attention must be paid to the
possibility of the presence of a more primary personality disturbance; such underlying disturbance will be diagnosed when recognized. Reactions will be differentiated as defined below.” (p. 38). This was then followed by the categories
of Antisocial Reaction, referring to people who are “always in trouble,” Dyssocial
Reaction, “individuals who manifest disregard for the usual social codes,” and
Sexual Deviation, “such as homosexuality, transvestitism, pedophilia, fetishism,
and sexual sadism” (pp. 38–39).
Both DSM-I and DSM-II were based in psychodynamic theory. As a definition for Psychoneurotic Disorders, DSM-I states, “The chief characteristic of
Why People Become Patients 115
these disorders is anxiety which may be directly felt and expressed or which
may be unconsciously and automatically controlled by the utilization of various defense mechanisms (depression, conversion, displacement, etc.)” (p. 31).
DSM-II (1968) uses the exact wording as a definition of the term Neuroses
(p. 39).
With the publication of DSM-III in 1980, the profession had done away
with the term neurosis. The new term was disorder. The disorders were no
longer defined in the psychodynamic light of expressions of anxiety, but rather
as criteria that were more behaviorally based. Each disorder now had a series of
criteria that limited the freedom for clinicians to interpret and adjust the categories. For the first time, clinicians had to stay with the criteria sets as defining
a particular disorder. The definitions of disorders now ran from page 35 to page
335, a total of 300 pages, or roughly 10 times the number of pages devoted to
definitions in the previous text.
Another important change in DSM-III was the idea of diagnosing an individual on five separate axes. This multiaxial diagnosis allowed the clinician to
identify and code, “aspects of the environment, and areas of functioning that
might be overlooked if the focus was on assessing a single presenting problem.”
(p. 23). The five axes were
• Axis I Clinical Syndromes
• Axis II Personality Disorders
• Specific Developmental Disorders
• Axis III Physical Disorders and Problems
• Axis IV Severity of Psychosocial Stressors
• Axis V Highest Level of Adaptive Functioning in the Past Year
Conditions not attributable to a mental disorder might still be a focus of
attention or treatment and would be coded with a descriptive “V Code.”
To continue our comparison, Antisocial Personality Disorder is defined
in DSM-III (1980) as, “a Personality Disorder in which there are a history of
continuous and chronic antisocial behavior in which the rights of others are
violated” (p. 318). The definition no longer includes sexual deviation. Homosexuality is only diagnosed when it is ego-dystonic (the individual is unhappy
or displeased with his or her homosexuality).
In 1983, DSM-III was revised as DSM-III-R. The reason for this rather rapid
revision was that, “the data were emerging from new studies that were inconsistent with some of the diagnostic criteria.” In addition, there were “many instances in which the criteria were not entirely clear, were inconsistent across
categories, or were even contradictory” (p. xvii). In DSM-III-R, the criteria sets
(definitions now take up 336 pages, another 10% increase), Antisocial Personality Disorder is now defined as, “a pattern of irresponsible and antisocial behavior beginning in childhood or early adolescence and continuing into
adulthood” (p. 342).
When DSM-IV was published in 1994, the definition of terms had swelled
to an astounding 650 pages. The description of Antisocial Personality Disorder
is the same, though some criteria differ from DSM-III-R.
116 Introduction
Finally, DSM-IV-TR was published in 2000. The criteria sets are generally
unchanged but there is a substantial revision of the descriptions, features, cultural, age, and gender differences, associated features, prevalence, course of the
disorder, familial pattern, and differential diagnosis. The definition of terms
covers 703 pages. Now we have good news and bad news. The good news is that
there will continue to be increasing specificity in succeeding volumes of DSM
throughout your career as a psychologist. DSM-V is due in 2012. Given the continuous size increase, the bad news is that the sheer weight of DSM in the future will surely cause major muscle strain.
The Range of Disorders
DSM is an evolving concept and document. The students reading this book will,
in the course of their career, likely meet several revisions of the manual. We
cannot, in the context of this chapter offer an in-depth discussion of the broad
range of mental disorders. For an excellent view or review of psychopathology,
see Kring, Davison, Neale, and Johnson(2006).
To acquaint the reader with why people become specific kinds of patients,
we offer the fledgling clinician an overview of the current diagnostic nomenclature and its categories of psychopathology.
Before we begin, we want to emphasize three points. First, not everyone
will fit neatly into a single category or diagnostic group. Second, we are emphasizing the disorders that are most commonly seen in clinical practice. The DSM
has many, many more that are unusual or even rare. A fuller description and diagnostic markers for these disorders are the purview of another course in
psychopathology or advanced abnormal psychology. Finally, and by far the most
important consideration is for the student to be aware of the most dreaded and
dreadful emotional or mental disorder that has ever been observed. It is simply
called “The Student’s Disease.” Generally, it is first manifested in the undergraduate years during the Introductory Psychology course when studying the chapter on abnormal psychology. It is often exacerbated in the later undergraduate
years or early graduate years when taking a course specific to psychopathology.
It is at this point that the disease strikes with its full weight. The student see him
or herself (or some significant other) in every diagnostic category. They become
upset (or obsessed) with having diseases that will likely render them incapacitated in a short period of time. As you go through the next pages, BEWARE!
Disorders Usually First Diagnosed in Infancy, Childhood,
or Adolescence
Mental Retardation
You have likely heard someone demeaning the intellectual capacity of other
persons by calling them morons, idiots, or imbeciles. What are presently insults
were once legitimate categories for delineating levels of mental retardation.
Likewise even the term retardation has come to have a pejorative meaning, as in
the slang term “You’re a RE-tard.”
DSM requires three conditions for the diagnosis of mental retardation. First,
the individual must have significantly subaverage intellectual functioning: (an IQ
Why People Become Patients 117
of approximately 70 or below). This score should be derived from an individually
administered IQ test rather than a group testing. The second requirement for this
diagnosis is far vaguer. It requires that the individual have concurrent deficits or
impairments in present adaptive functioning (the person’s effectiveness in meeting the standards expected for his or her age by his or her cultural group) in at
least two of the following areas: communication, self-care, home living, social/
interpersonal skills, use of community resources, self-direction, functional academic skills, work, leisure, health, and safety. There are many other disorders
that might also lead to or cause impairment in adaptive function. The final factor
is that the origin of the problem was during the developmental period, prior to
age 18. The following groupings are ranges, rather than a single number, because
each individual cannot be assigned a single descriptive number.
The following ranges are based on the degree of severity reflecting the assessed level of intellectual impairment:
317 Mild Mental Retardation: IQ level from 50–55 to approximately 70
318.0 Moderate Mental Retardation: IQ level 35–40 to 50–55
318.1 Severe Mental Retardation: IQ level 20–25 to 35–40
318.2 Profound Mental Retardation: IQ level below 20 or 25
319 Mental Retardation, Severity Unspecified: when there is strong
presumption of Mental Retardation but the person’s intelligence is
difficult or untestable by standard testing instruments.
Mental retardation is coded on Axis II.
Learning Disorders
A common problem seen in consultation with children and adolescence has to
do with their performance in their “work”—the acquisition of basic academic
skills. These problems include reading disorders, mathematics disorders, disorders of written expression, developmental coordination disorder, expressive language disorder, mixed receptive language disorder, and phonological disorder.
In all cases, the individual’s performance is measured by individually
administered standardized tests. The individual’s performance on standard measures is found to be substantially below the age or grade level expected, given the
child’s chronological age, measured intelligence, and age-appropriate education.
The previously noted problems significantly (and this is a key word) interfere with the person’s academic achievement, the individual’s activities of daily
living that require the particular skills being evaluated, or the individual’s social interactions. Finally, if there is a sensory deficit, the difficulties that the individual has are in excess of those usually associated with the deficit. If a child
is deaf, speech problems may have resulted from the lack or limiting of auditory
input. The disorder indicates that the person has problems above and beyond
those expected of a deaf (or blind) child.
Pervasive Developmental Disorders
Pervasive developmental disorders (PDD) are well named. The problems that are
capsular in this group are all-encompassing. They reach in and affect every part
of the individual’s life. Second, they represent a major difference in functioning
118 Introduction
from their age-level companions. The deficits of many children with PDD are obvious early in the individual’s development. Probably the best known of the pervasive developmental disorders is autism. It is useful to think of an autistic
spectrum. We can find children at every level from the most severe forms to very
mild forms that might go unnoticed.
The social interactions of the autistic individual are identified by some potential behaviors. There is often a marked impairment in the use of multiple
nonverbal behaviors such as making and maintaining appropriate eye contact,
appropriate facial expression, and body postures. There may also be a failure or
great difficulty in developing peer relationships appropriate to the individual’s
age or developmental level. For example a 10-year-old child is most comfortable and chooses to play with 5-year-old children when there are other children available who would be more appropriate.
Typically, children share things that they enjoy with significant others.
This might involve bringing drawings home from school or nursery school, joining with family members in fun activities, or pointing out objects of interest
(“Mommy, look at the horse”). The autistic child seems to lack the motivation
or skill to spontaneously share enjoyment, interests, or their achievements
with other people. Finally, there is a lack of social or emotional reciprocity.
There are also qualitative impairments in communication such as a delay
in, or total lack of, the development of spoken language. The child who lacks
language but attempts to convey ideas, feelings, or wants through alternative
modes of communication such as gesture or mime would not be considered as
having the same type of communication impairment. In individuals with adequate speech, there is a marked impairment in the individual’s ability or motivation to initiate or sustain a conversation with other people. Their communication
often includes the stereotyped and repetitive use of words, terms, phrases, or
ideas. The individual may develop an idiosyncratic language that may differ minimally or markedly from the language use of the family or of the society.
The autistic individual typically lacks the varied, spontaneous makebelieve play or social imitative play appropriate to the individual’s developmental level. Instead, their behavior, interests, and activities are restricted,
repetitive, and stereotyped. Their interest in a subject may reflect an unusual
level of preoccupation, intensity, or focus. The individual shows a behavioral
pattern that seems to be inflexible, and adheres to specific, nonfunctional routines or rituals. The diagnostic sign that is most noticeable to the observer is the
autistic individual’s stereotyped and repetitive motor mannerisms such as
hand or finger flapping or twisting, or complex whole-body movement. The
clinician must be careful here, because other disorders may show somewhat
similar behaviors; for example, visually challenged children often “finger-flic”
by waving their fingers in front of their eyes. This causes alterations in light
and shadow and is visually stimulating.
Some autistic children show incredible aptitude at a skill that is far and
away above “normal.” They might be able to multiply a 10-digit number by another 10-digit number at the speed of an electronic calculator. Other autistic savants (learned persons) can hear a piece of music and then play it from
memory. These same individuals may be unable to learn to read music, but they
have a “golden ear.”
Why People Become Patients 119
Finally, there may be an intense and pervasive interest with the parts of
objects as opposed to the whole, such as interest in taking objects apart without
the apparent curiosity of what makes the object work. They may then play with
a wheel, gear, or part.
The identification of autism involves delays or abnormal functioning in at
least one of the following areas, with onset prior to age 3 years: (a) social interaction, (b) language as used in social communication, or (c) symbolic or imaginative play.
Asperger’s Disorder
Asperger’s Disorder can be thought of as the highest functioning manifestation within the autistic spectrum. There are many of the same qualities, behaviors, and signs noted earlier. The differences may be that the individual is
“almost” normal. Their awareness of social cues, attention to interactive details, or verbalizations may be close to normal, but just miss the mark. These
individuals may be labeled as “eccentric,” “weird,” or “a little off.” They may
do very well in academic areas because of the high level of structure involved
and required. The largest difficulty may be in their lack of attention to social
cues. They seem to miss them. They might be prone to enter a conversation
by interrupting and overlooking the appropriate social niceties. They may
have difficulty in relationships because of their lack of attention (though not
awareness) of appropriate social behavior. The disturbance causes clinically
significant impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of
functioning.
Unlike the description of autism, there is no clinically significant general
delay in language (e.g., single words are used by age 2 years, communicative
phrases by age 3 years), and there is no clinically significant delay in cognitive
development or development of age-appropriate self-help skills, adaptive behavior (other than in social interaction), and curiosity about the environment
in childhood.
In many settings, these individuals may be very successful. They focus on
things rather than people, so that they may be the computer geek or math nerdwho succeeds in structured, task-oriented settings, but has significant problems
in interpersonal circumstances. Their nonattention or recognition of environmental or social cues may cause them difficulty.
Attention-Deficit and Disruptive Behavior
Another disorder that is commonly diagnosed in children is Attention
Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder. Once again, the pattern is maladaptive and inconsistent with the child’s developmental level. There are two equally problematic components, the lack of attention and the high level of activity. These
children often fail to give close attention to the details of a game, an academic
requirement, or a social interaction. They often make what appear to be careless mistakes in schoolwork, work, or other activities even after they have been
warned to be careful. They may be highly motivated to be careful, but their attention seems to wander. This is not related only to school activities; the child
may have difficulty sustaining attention in many tasks (doing chores at home)
or in play activities.
120 Introduction
The child may not seem to listen, even when spoken to directly. The child
(or adult) often does not follow through on instructions and fails to finish
schoolwork, chores, or duties in the workplace. This occurs even though the individual is motivated to comply, wants to do well, and appears to understand
the instructions or requirements.
Because of the attentional deficits, these children have difficulty organizing tasks and activities. They may even appear confused and disorganized and
will conspire to avoid tasks that require sustained mental focus and effort.
Nothing is more frustrating for AD/HD individuals and for their families than
the disorganization that has the child losing things necessary for tasks or activities (e.g., toys, school assignments, pencils, books, or tools). Further, the attention problem is both caused by and typical of their ease of distraction by both
external and internal stimuli.
Hyperactivity
Hyperactive children often fidget with their hands or feet or may be seen
squirming in their seat. It is important to remember age-appropriate fidgeting.
It is difficult for a child to always behave in every situation. When asked to
stand in line and wait, the hyperactive child may be fidgeting and squirming in
place. Other times, these children may leave their seat in a classroom, at the
dinner table, at the movies, or in other situations in which remaining seated is
the expected (or demanded) behavior. When other children are actively moving
about, running, or climbing, the level of activity of the hyperactive child is excessive and may be inappropriate. When hyperactivity is seen in adolescents or
adults, it may have all the previously noted actions, but also may include subjective feelings of restlessness.
When hyperactive children are expected to spend time restfully and quietly, they have great difficulty and act as if “driven by a motor.” In classroom
settings or at home, these children often talk excessively, impulsively, or compulsively. They have difficulty waiting their turn while other children (or siblings) are awaiting a turn. The hyperactive child often blurts out answers
before the teacher’s or parent’s questions have been fully asked. They will interrupt or intrude on the conversations or activities of others. The frequent
statement is, “but Mom . . .” A key diagnostic factor is that there must be clear
evidence of clinically significant impairment in social, academic, or occupational functioning that does not occur exclusively during the course of some
other disorder such as a Pervasive Developmental Disorder, Schizophrenia, or
other Psychotic Disorder and are not better accounted for by another mental
disorder (e.g., Mood Disorder, Anxiety Disorder, Dissociative Disorder, or a Personality Disorder).
Conduct Disorder
Conduct disorder involves a repetitive and persistent pattern of behavior in
which the basic rights of others or major age-appropriate societal norms or
rules are violated. These can include physical, verbal, or emotional aggression
to people (children and adults) or to animals. This aggressive behavior can be
cruel, bullying, threatening or intimidating behavior. These children are prone
Why People Become Patients 121
to initiate physical fights or cause physical damage to others. They may use
their hands but may also use a weapon such as a bat, brick, broken bottle, rock,
knife, or gun. They may also be physically cruel to animals and injure, torture,
or kill them. They may force another child into sexual activity.
They seem to have no compunction about mugging, purse snatching, and extortion, armed robbery, selling contraband, or injuring another
person for profit. They may have stolen items of substantial value without confronting a victim (e.g., shoplifting, breaking and entering, forgery,
auto theft).
They demonstrate a lack of respect for the property of others and seem to
have little hesitation in deliberately destroying the property of others, or of
public buildings (schools, churches, governmental buildings). The destructive
behaviors might include fire setting with the intention of causing serious damage, vandalism, or explosives. They may be more circumspect in deceitfulness
as well. They often lie to obtain goods or favors or when confronted by their actions, to avoid obligations, consequences, or punishment.
These children often come into conflict with parental, school, or
legal authorities because of serious violations of rules. Beginning before age
13 years, they may violate curfew by staying out at night despite parental
prohibitions, or might have run away from home overnight at least twice
while living in parental or parental surrogate home. As a result of their
challenges to “the system,” they may be truant from school. Overall, their behavior causes clinically significant impairment in social, academic, or occupational functioning.
When the problems are mild, there are few if any conduct problems in excess of those required for the diagnosis, and the conduct problems cause only
minor harm to others. A moderate disorder reflects a greater number of conduct
problems and the effect on others would be between “mild” and “severe.” Finally, a severe conduct disorder would involve any conduct problems in excess
of those required to make the diagnosis and their conduct problems would cause
considerable harm to others.
Oppositional Defiant Disorder
When a child has been diagnosed as having an Oppositional Defiant Disorder, it
is often a case of parents, teachers, clergy, or coaches being unable to
deal/cope/handle the child. These children display a pattern of negativistic,
hostile, and defiant behavior that has been recognizable for at least 6 months,
during which there are several markers including often losing his or her temper, arguing with adults over small details and issues that do not warrant the
time or energy for the child to object or argue; when asked to follow rules or requests, the child shows active defiance or refusal to comply. The key idea is that
the refusal is active as opposed to a more passive refusal. These children often
seem to go out of their way to do things that deliberately annoy people. When
called to task for misdeeds or mistakes, they find scapegoats or simply blame
others for their mistakes or misbehavior. Hypersensitivity causes this child to be
easily annoyed by others, which results in the child acting in a resentful, spiteful, or vindictive manner.
122 Introduction
What has been described could easily describe most normal adolescents.
As noted, the key to diagnosing problematic behavior is that the behavior is
more frequent or more maladaptive than would be typically observed in individuals of a comparable age, gender, social setting, and developmental level.
The identified behavior causes the child clinically significant impairment in social, academic, or occupational functioning.
Delirium, Dementia, Amnestic and Other Cognitive Disorders
Imagine the following: As you are reading this book the words suddenly start to
run across the page, the content is confusing, you keep losing your place, and
you forget the courses that you are taking and the name of your best friend.
Your first response may be to self-instruct yourself to get more sleep. But what
if these are not the symptoms of sleep deprivation, an occupational hazard of
being a student? What if something is wrong with your brain?
The problems discussed in this section are disorders with psychological
impact that are caused by temporary or permanent changes to the structure,
functioning, and metabolism of the brain. The problems caused by this type of
disorder range from slow deterioration of mental abilities such as judgment,
memory, concentration, abstract thinking, impulse control, intellectual abilities, social functioning, and occupational functioning to a rapid and catastrophic loss. The differences between these two types of presentation are
significant. Diseases such as Alzheimer’s disease are well known to cause memory lapses that may range from minor (misplacing one’s glasses) to potentially
life-threatening (leaving a pot on the stove and forgetting it, causing a fire).
These disorders come under the broad heading of dementia.
Part of the loss is not just to the individual who may be aware of the difficulty in remembering things, but also to their family and friends. They may,
when the deterioration is serious, forget the names of their children, spouses,
and friends. Hilda, married to Harry for 55 years, was placed in a care facility
when Harry could no longer care for her at home. He visited her every day,
and sat with her for hours, looking at pictures of their children and grandchildren. By her comments, it was clear that to her these were just nice pictures
of nice children. She did not know their names, or her relationship to them.
When children and grandchildren visited, it was, once again, a visit by nice
people. At one point, when Harry entered her room, Hilda began screaming
that a strange man was there and for someone to get him away from her. She
could be calmed, but Harry was inconsolable. He had truly lost his wife.
She lived and breathed, but was not available in any way for him. He grieved
her loss.
When there are losses of judgment, these individuals may lose the polish
and control that, over the years, characterized them. The prim and proper individual may now use coarse language, make obscene statements and gestures,
make sexual advances to strangers, or make inappropriate racial, ethnic, or gender statements.
There may also be a disturbance of consciousness (reduced clarity of
awareness of their environment) with reduced ability to focus, sustain, or shift
attention. In addition to memory deficits, there may be disorientation, lan-
Why People Become Patients 123
guage disturbance, or the development of a perceptual disturbance that is not
better accounted for by another disorder such as a preexisting psychotic process. The brain deterioration may cause fluctuation through the day, so that at
one time the individual is clear and calm, and at another time, for no apparent
reason, the individual’s behavior is far worse.
A thorough physical examination with laboratory work is important because some of these same symptoms may be the sequelae or physiological consequences of a general medical condition, toxic reactions to drugs, food allergies, or
medication overdose.
There can also be a rather rapid onset dementia that is caused by a stroke.
This is caused by a reduction or loss of oxygen to the brain (which as you know,
is a major consumer of oxygen). This loss of oxygen can cause the damage or
even loss of language, loss of sensation, deterioration or loss of motor skills
(gross and fine), and coordination problems. If the loss of oxygen is small and
confined to a specific area, the loss may be minimal and the skills or abilities
may return. Cognitive rehabilitation, physical therapy, and psychotherapy may
all be used to assist individuals in their recovery. In other, more serious circumstances, the losses may be permanent.
Another brain-related problem is delirium. This is a state of severe mental
confusion. The delirium may come on quite suddenly and may start with restlessness, a lack of coherence in thought and speech, a lack of clarity in speech
(words may be mispronounced or slurred), and the individual may not be oriented to time, place, or person. There may also be perceptual disturbances and
hallucinations. Many factors must be considered in treating individuals with
brain-related disorders.
Substance-Related Disorders
It is Saturday night, and a group of students are setting out to have a good time.
They are ready to PARTY! A likely part of that good time will involve the use of
one or several intoxicants. These may be taken very quickly, or savored over a
longer period. The substances may be legal (nicotine or caffeine), illegal (e.g.,
cocaine, marijuana, heroin, or methamphetamine), the substance may be illegal at one age but legal at an older age (e.g., alcohol). The substance may be
legal for one use and then misused to achieve a “high” (e.g., inhalants, gasoline,
cooking spray). The substances may be taken by choice, or ingested unknowingly as in so-called date-rape drugs.
This is not the forum for us to argue the legality, acceptability, or prevalence of substance use or the rules governing substance use and misuse. Students will have their own ideas of substance use relative to the needed quantity
to have the desired effect (feeling good, getting high), availability, cost, and legality. A case might be made that despite the fact that every pack of cigarettes
carries on it a warning from the Surgeon General regarding the health risks of
smoking, people continue to smoke. About the only thing that these individuals stop is reading their cigarette packs.
Several terms have come to the fore, and others recede based on acceptability and political correctness of the term. Drug abuse has been replaced
by drug misuse. The problems come when the choices to use or misuse various
124 Introduction
intoxicants are no longer easily made, but related to psychological or physiological factors.
Substance Dependence
Dependence is a maladaptive pattern of substance use, leading to clinically significant impairment or distress, as manifested by three (or more) of the following, occurring at any time within a 12-month period.
1. There is tolerance as defined by either a need for markedly increased amounts
of the substance to achieve intoxication or desired effect, or markedly diminished effect with continued use of the same amount of the substance.
2. There is withdrawal, as manifested by either the characteristic withdrawal syndrome for that particular substance inasmuch as withdrawal for some substances
is far more difficult or dangerous than withdrawal from other substances, or the
same (or a closely related) substance is taken to relieve or avoid withdrawal
symptoms.
3. The substance is often taken in larger amounts or over a longer period than the
individual had intended.
4. There is a persistent desire but unsuccessful efforts to cut down or control use of
the particular substance. In this regard, the individual “means well,” but has
been unsuccessful at meeting personal goals of cutting back.
5. There is a great deal of time, energy, and effort, and possibly personal risk spent
in activities necessary to obtain the substance (e.g., visiting multiple doctors or
driving long distances), using the substance (e.g., chain-smoking), recover from
the effects of the substance use, going into unsafe areas to obtain the substance,
or risking legal problems if arrested.
6. The substance use supersedes social, occupational, or recreational activities. Time
with family, friends, studying is given up or reduced because of substance use.
7. The substance use is continued despite the individual’s knowledge of having a
persistent or recurrent physical or psychological problem that is likely to have
been caused or exacerbated by the substance (e.g., current cocaine use) despite
recognition of cocaine-induced depression, or continued drinking despite recognition that an ulcer was made worse by alcohol consumption, continued smoking despite a diagnosis of respiratory distress.
Criteria for Substance Abuse
Although abuse and dependence have many similar characteristics, there are
differences in terms of the degree of severity, involvement, and maladaptive
behavior in the person’s life. Dependence requires three or more criteria; abuse
requires only one. Substance abuse involves a maladaptive pattern of substance
use leading to clinically significant impairment or distress, as manifested by one
(or more) of the following, occurring within a 12-month period:
1. recurrent substance use resulting in a failure (not just a limitation) to fulfill
major role obligations at work, school, or home (e.g., repeated absences or poor
work performance related to substance use; substance-related absences, suspen-


sions, or expulsions from school; neglect of children, or lack of caring for one’s
household);
2. recurrent substance use in situations in which it is physically hazardous (e.g.,
driving an automobile or operating a machine when impaired by substance
use);
3. recurrent substance-related legal problems (e.g., arrests for substance-related
possession, sales, or disorderly conduct resulting from the substance use);
4. continued substance use despite having persistent or recurrent social or interpersonal problems caused or exacerbated by the effects of the substance (e.g., arguments with one’s spouse about consequences of intoxication, physical fights,
loss of friends, expulsion from clubs or other social groups).
Finally, the symptoms have never met the criteria for Substance Dependence for this particular class of substance (DSM-IV-TR, p. 191).
Criteria for Substance Intoxication
Have you ever been the designated driver at a party? It is your job to get everyone home safely because these other individuals are intoxicated. Intoxication is
defined as the development of a reversible substance-specific syndrome due to
recent ingestion of (or exposure to) a substance. Obviously, different substances may produce similar or identical reactions and syndromes. It may not
be clear without a laboratory drug screen just what drugs are “on board” that
are creating the observable behaviors.
The individual will likely manifest clinically significant maladaptive behavioral or psychological changes due to the effect of the substance on the central nervous system (e.g., belligerence, mood lability, cognitive impairment,
impaired judgment, impaired social, coordination difficulty, impulse control
problems, or occupational functioning) that develop during or shortly after use
of the substance. It is essential to have a medical evaluation because certain
neurological issues noted earlier in this chapter (e.g., stroke) can cause similar
reactions and behaviors. Thus it is important to determine that the symptoms
are not due to a general medical condition or are not better accounted for by
another mental disorder. Some substances that are misused are prescription
medications. Benzodiazepines, pain medications, sedatives, or other drugs with
codeine for coughs are also drugs of abuse. These drugs may be used for a long
period and may become habit forming.
A final statement relates to polysubstance abuse and dependence. Individuals involved in polysubstance abuse will ingest, smoke, drink, inhale, or inject
any substance that they believe will get them high.
Schizophrenia and Other Psychotic Disorders
An old joke states, “Neurotics spend their lives building castles in the sky. The
psychotic moves in.” Images of homeless men and women living on the street,
apparently deep in conversation with others, whom only they can see, are
common. Freud called dreams the normal person’s psychosis. In our dreams,
we can fly, talk to people that we have never met, perform acts that we would
126 Introduction
never attempt, or go to places that we have never been. Dreams may be so real
that people who have a sad dream may awaken with their face wet from tears.
Your sleeping partner elbows you during the night to stop your loud laughing
at what must have been a very funny joke or experience. Psychosis, however, is
far more serious. Especially in schizophrenia, the patient can have positive
symptoms (referring to behavioral excesses). They have observable and noticeable behaviors that are typical, pervasive, and frequent.
Psychosis may include delusions (ideas and beliefs that are contrary to reality). These distorted ideas are maintained despite any and all contradictory evidence—this can be summarized as “Just because I am paranoid doesn’t mean
people are not following me.” Probably the most common delusions are those
of persecution. The belief is that “people” are out to harm them. These may be
from the government, outer space, or a secret society that only they know
about. Often these delusions are highly detailed, use facts from the news to
support their ideas, typically involve logical leaps that are hard to follow, but
make sense to the individual.
There may also be hallucinations. These involve perceptions that occur
without adequate sensory input. The individual will smell, see, hear, or feel
things that others near them do not perceive. The most frequent type of hallucination is auditory. Visual and olfactory hallucinations are far less frequent.
When the individual “hears” the voices, they often respond in conversation or
respond behaviorally through action by injuring or damaging themselves or
others. The source of the voice may range from George Washington to God.
They often have disorganized speech with frequent derailment or incoherence. Ideas flow at a rapid rate and while the listener may detect themes and
ideas in the words, they often do not make any sense. One word/idea leads to
another with alliteration or a rhyme as the only apparent connection. The Liberty Bell may, in the next sentence become the Statue of Liberty. A single idea
may trigger multiple tracks for the individual.
Similarly, their dress, actions, posture may all be affected. They might fashion a hat from aluminum foil to stop damaging rays from going into their brain.
There are also negative symptoms that are behavioral deficits. These include affective flattening, wherein these individuals appear to be without emotion. No matter what the external stimuli, they evidence no external emotional
reaction, although their internal emotions may be at a high pitch. With low
levels of energy, they may sit and stare for hours at a time and not attend to
meals, their personal hygiene, or their dress. This is termed avolition. They may
also show alogia, which involves both impoverished production and content of
speech. The person may show very few words, monosyllabic responses, or
many words without any real content.
The schizophrenic individual typically experiences social and occupational dysfunction. Major areas of functioning such as work, interpersonal relations, or self-care are markedly below the level achieved prior to the onset of
the disorder. Onset is usually late adolescence or early adulthood. When the
onset is in childhood or adolescence, which is far rarer, there is more severe impairment of interpersonal, academic, or occupational achievement.
Many of the positive and negative symptoms listed could also be typical of
substance use. It is essential that the disturbance is not due to the direct physi-
Why People Become Patients 127
ological effects of a substance (e.g., a drug of abuse, a medication) or a general
medical condition.
If there is a history of Autistic Disorder or another Pervasive Developmental Disorder, the additional diagnosis of Schizophrenia is made only if prominent delusions or hallucinations are also present for at least a month (or less if
successfully treated). The classification of a longitudinal course (can be applied
only after at least 1 year has elapsed since the initial onset of active-phase
symptoms).
To understand the complex thinking of the individual diagnosed with the
Paranoid Type of schizophrenia, think of Tolkien’s The Hobbit or Lord of the Rings
(1986). The invention of racial groups, a genealogy, a geography, and social and
political systems, displays the creativity, originality, imagination, and inspiration of a great writer. If we see the constructions of the paranoid schizophrenic
as akin to this, we can start to understand why the delusions are so compelling
for the individual.
The Catatonic Type of schizophrenia is characterized by alternating between episodes of extreme agitation and what has been termed “waxy flexibility.” That is, patients can be placed in a particular position, or have their limbs
placed in a particular way and will remain in that position. This variant is not
typically seen because the use of psychotropic medication has increased.
Schizoaffective Disorder
As the name implies, this disorder is a mix of schizophrenia and an affective
disorder. The individual will have hallucinations and delusions that are characteristic of a psychotic process, and symptoms of a mood disturbance during the
same time.
Depressive Disorders
Depression has been called “the common cold of emotional disorders.” It
would be rare to find an individual who has never experienced some variant of
depression from being “down,” “blue,” or having the “blahs.” When the depressed feelings are ongoing, the individual may meet the criteria for some
depressive disorder. It may be a major depressive disorder with only a single episode, and the experience may be mild, moderate, severe without psychotic features, or severe with psychotic features.
Individuals who have a number of depressed episodes may be diagnosed
as having major depressive disorder, recurrent. This implies that the depression
returns on some periodic basis and that there have been two or more major depressive episodes. To be considered separate episodes, there must be the presence an interval of at least 2 consecutive months in which criteria are not met
for a Major Depressive Episode.
The symptoms of depression include being depressed for most of the day
every day, a diminished interest or pleasure in activities nearly every day, significant weight loss or gain when not trying to lose or gain weight, problems with
sleep, either difficulty sleeping or problems in waking, slowed or increased
motor activity, fatigue or loss of energy, feelings of worthlessness, problems in
128 Introduction
concentration, or decision making, and suicidal thinking or recurrent thoughts
of death.
Dysthymic Disorder
Many children are familiar with the characters in A. A. Milne’s Winnie-the-Pooh.
Eeyore, the donkey, is likely a dysthymic individual. For Eeyore, nothing is ever
good, much less great. For Eeyore, everything is “O . . . kay.” Dysthymia involves a depressed mood for “most of the day, for more days than not, as indicated either by subjective account or observation by others, for at least 2 years.”
Another common variant of an affective disorder is Bipolar Disorder, formerly known as manic depression. The manifestation of Bipolar Disorder is
that the individual cycles through being depressed and being manic. This includes a range of symptoms that involve a grandiose view of self, decreased
need for sleep where the individual may not sleep for days, or sleep only two
hours per night, speech that is pressured so that the individual speaks very
quickly as if the words are being forced out under some strain, becoming easily
distracted, a sensation or experience of thought racing at high speed, and the
possibility of painful or impulsive behavior such as gambling, spending, or
promiscuous activities.
Anxiety Disorders
Anxiety is a common and important part of human functioning. It manifests itself as an emotion, a physiological state, through behaviors, and as a set of cognitions. The basic idea underlying all anxiety is that there is danger in the world
(which is true), but anxious individuals have the concomitant belief that they
are unsuited or unskilled to effectively cope with the danger.
The various anxiety disorders need to be viewed as an anxiety spectrum,
so that typically an individual has many pieces of the several anxiety disorders.
The various types of anxiety depend on where the individual believes the danger will come from. In Generalized Anxiety Disorder, the danger is everywhere,
and they must be ready to respond with their typical safety behavior of avoidance. In Phobia, the danger comes from a discrete object or situation. In Social
Anxiety, the potential for danger in social situations is foremost. For ObsessiveCompulsive Disorder, the danger can be kept at a safe distance by performing
specific behaviors. In Posttraumatic Stress Disorder, the danger is deeply set
within a network of associations and memories that invade both waking and
sleeping experience, triggering fear, avoidance, and numbing of affect.
In Simple Phobia or Social Phobia, the person may have panic attacks, but
these occur only in the presence of specific phobic stimuli. The diagnosis of
Panic Disorder is made only when attacks are unexpected and do not occur immediately before or during exposure to a specific situation that almost always
causes anxiety. Individuals with Panic Disorder may believe that they are going
to die unless they swiftly and immediately leave whatever they are doing (e.g.,
driving, shopping).
The distinction between Panic Disorder with and without Agoraphobia
can be difficult if the agoraphobic avoidance is mild. When asked if they avoid
Why People Become Patients 129
many situations, clients with panic attacks may answer no, leading one to conclude that they have Panic Disorder without Agoraphobia. However, patterns of
avoidance may be subtle or may have continued for so long that the client does
not recognize the avoidance.
Social Phobia is a fear of exposure to the scrutiny of others, particularly
the fear of embarrassment or humiliation due to one’s actions while others are
watching. Although seemingly straightforward, the diagnosis of Social Phobia
can be complex. Social anxiety in and of itself is not sufficient to warrant the
diagnosis of Social Phobia. There must be a persistent fear of one or more situations in which the person is exposed to possible scrutiny by others and fears
that he or she may act in a way that will be humiliating or embarrassing. Social
Phobias often include fear that one’s anxiety will be noticed by others. Thus, a
social phobic may be unwilling to write in the view of others for fear that his or
her hand will tremble or may avoid social situations for fear of perspiring excessively because of nervousness.
A Simple Phobia is a persistent fear of a specific object or situation and is
usually circumscribed. Fears of specific stimuli such as heights, insects, snakes,
and so on are common but would be considered to be Simple Phobias if the fear
and/or avoidance resulted in significant impairment or distress. Simple phobias
range from the commonplace, such as fear of flying, to the idiosyncratic, such
as fear of the wind.
Many clients who report a fear of germs or dirt have developed elaborate
cleaning or hand-washing rituals. Clients may be so used to their extensive
strategies for preventing harm that they no longer view them as rituals and may
not think to mention them. Even if fears and phobias exist, a person who also
has significant obsessions or compulsions would be diagnosed as having an Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder.
In Generalized Anxiety Disorder, the term generalized leads many to mistakenly assume that the anxiety is continuous, pervasive, and “free-floating.”
Careful assessment of individuals with Generalized Anxiety Disorder makes it
clear that there are definite variations in the presence and intensity of anxiety,
depending on the situation and cognitions of the client at the time.
Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) has received much attention in recent years due to the high incidence of PTSD among combat veterans. However,
PTSD can occur following any extraordinary traumatic event such as a natural
disaster, a major accident, or victimization. Clinically, it is valuable to distinguish between PTSD resulting from a single traumatic event and PTSD resulting
from recurrent trauma. Persons with PTSD stemming from recurrent trauma
appear to be much more difficult to treat effectively.
For most anxiety disorders, there is some combination of the following experiences at varying levels of intensity:
• palpitations, pounding heart, or accelerated heart rate
• sweating
• trembling or shaking
• sensations of shortness of breath or smothering
• feeling of choking
130 Introduction
• chest pain or discomfort
• nausea or abdominal distress
• feeling dizzy, unsteady, lightheaded, or faint
• derealization (feelings of unreality) or depersonalization (being detached from
oneself)
• fear of losing control or going crazy
• fear of dying
• paresthesias (numbness or tingling sensations)
• chills or hot flushes
• difficulty concentrating
• hypervigilance
• exaggerated startle response
Somatoform Disorders
Somatoform disorders represent identifiable physical symptoms that are not
fully explained by the individual’s general medical condition or by the direct effects of some substance. The physical symptoms are not something that the individual causes or attempts to fake. Just about any bodily system can be
affected by the disorder. There are several types of disorder.
In Somatization Disorder, there is a history of many physical complaints
beginning before age 30 years that occur over a period of several years and result in treatment being sought or in significant impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning. Each of the following criteria
must have been met, with individual symptoms occurring at any time during
the course of the disturbance;
• four pain symptoms: a history of pain related to at least four different sites or
functions (e.g., head, abdomen, back, joints, extremities, chest, rectum, during
menstruation, during sexual intercourse, or during urination)
• two gastrointestinal symptoms: a history of at least two gastrointestinal
symptoms other than pain (e.g., nausea, bloating, vomiting other than during
pregnancy, diarrhea, or intolerance of several different foods)
• one sexual symptom: a history of at least one sexual or reproductive symptom other than pain (e.g., sexual indifference, erectile or ejaculatory dysfunction, irregular menses, excessive menstrual bleeding, vomiting throughout
pregnancy)
• one pseudoneurological symptom: a history of at least one symptom or
deficit suggesting a neurological condition not limited to pain (conversion
symptoms such as impaired coordination or balance, paralysis or localized
weakness, difficulty swallowing or lump in throat, aphonia, urinary retention, hallucinations, loss of touch or pain sensation, double vision, blindness,
deafness, seizures; dissociative symptoms such as amnesia; or loss of consciousness other than fainting)
Why People Become Patients 131
The symptoms are not intentionally produced or feigned (as in Factitious
Disorder or Malingering; DSM-IV-TR, p. 449).
Conversion Disorder can occur with a motor symptom or deficit/with
sensory symptom or a deficit/with seizures or convulsions.
Pain Disorders can be associated with psychological factors or associated
with both psychological factors and a general medical condition. This condition
might be acute or chronic.
Hypochondriasis, also termed health anxiety, involves a fear of the danger
of physical illness. The hypochondriac can interpret aches, pains, bumps, and
lumps as diseases and illnesses that defy medical evaluation. Despite many and
frequent medical visits, hypochondriacs cannot accept that the illnesses are
psychogenic rather than the result of some flaw or fault in their bodily functioning. They will spend time and money on shopping for the medical professional who can and will diagnose them as having a medical problem. Often
preoccupied with their concerns about illness, hypochondriacs will have difficulty maintaining relationships and family connections. While this illness preoccupation does not reach the level of a delusion, there is a quality of reality
being challenged in the constant search for elusive symptoms.
Body Dysmorphic Disorder is related to hypochondria in that these individuals believe that their body is defective and that their appearance needs to
be altered. It can be the motive for numerous plastic surgeries, alterations, or
enhancements. This does mean that every surgery is excessive. It is the ongoing
dissatisfaction that leads to multiple surgeries.
Factitious Disorders do not involve an intentional production or feigning
of physical or psychological signs or symptoms. There is an unconscious or
naive motivation of the individual to assume the sick role. Individuals may
even take drugs or medications to create the very symptoms for which they
seek treatment. Unlike malingering, they do not do this with a goal such as economic gain or for avoiding legal responsibility. Factitious disorders can be seen
with predominantly psychological signs and symptoms.
In malingering, the individual creates the disorder for some financial gain
or the avoidance of responsibility. Both disorders show what appears to be a
medical disorder. The malingering patient may not be as cooperative with a
medical team nor comply with a prescribed medication regiment, there may be
a marked discrepancy between the individual’s claimed difficulty and the findings on objective medical tests, and most important, there is some outside gain
or reward for maintaining the purported medical disorder.
Dissociative Disorders
The category of Dissociative Disorders includes Dissociative Amnesia, Dissociative Fugue, Dissociative Identity Disorder, and Depersonalization Disorder.
The common element to these disorders is “a disruption in the usually integrated functions of consciousness, memory, identity, or perception of the environment. The disturbance may be sudden or gradual, transient or chronic.”
(DSM-IV-TR, 2000, p. 477). Dissociative Amnesia involves difficulty or even
the inability to recall events or circumstances that were traumatic. Although
132 Introduction
patients may have vague and inaccurate memories, they can, over time, recover the lost data.
Dissociative Fugue is the stuff of books, stories, and movies. In a fugue
state, the individual may travel at a distance from their home, be unable to remember elements of the trip, and, in the course of the trip have conversations
with another person. In severe cases, the individual may assume a new identity,
not remembering his or her former identity.
Dissociative Identity Disorder can also present in a dramatic manner with
the individual having two or more distinct identities. Books and films such as
The Three Faces of Eve (Thigpen & Cleckley, 1957), or Sybil (Schreiber, 1977)
show examples of this disorder. The individual may have “alters” who are of
different ages than the patient, of different gender, or a different race or ethnicity. The debate regarding the apparent increase of this disorder is whether
we are becoming better able to identify such individuals or whether we are
over-diagnosing the disorder.
Depersonalization Disorder involves a persistent or recurrent experience
of feeling detached from, and as if one is an outside observer of, one’s mental
processes or body (e.g., feeling as if one is in a dream). During the depersonalization experience, reality testing remains intact while individuals may report
being able to “watch themselves as if in a movie.” This has also been labeled
spectatoring.
Sexual Disorders, Paraphilias, and Gender Identity Disorders
These disorders constitute a large and troubling area for the affected individual
and potentially for society.
Sexual Dysfunctions can occur in every phase of the sexual arousal cycle.
This includes disturbances in desire, excitement, orgasm, or resolution. The
dysfunction can be a lifelong type or acquired type, a generalized type or a situational type. Finally, the disorder might be due to psychological factors, medical/physical factors, substance use, or a combination of them.
Sexual dysfunctions include Sexual Desire Disorders such as Hypoactive
Sexual Desire Disorder where there is a lack of sexual desire and an absence of
sexual fantasy. The disorder may be global and include all forms of sexual expression. These individuals may engage in sexual activity with a low frequency
to satisfy a partner, but would not likely initiate sexual contact or expression.
If, however, this does not cause difficulty for the individual, it may not be perceived as a problem (e.g., two partners, both of whom have a hypoactive sexual desire).
In Sexual Aversion Disorder, there is a distaste, repugnance, and avoidance of sexual contact with a partner. At an extreme, it could also include aversions to kissing, touching, or fondling. To be considered a disorder, the aversion
must cause significant distress and interpersonal difficulty for the individual.
Sexual Arousal Disorders for both men and women involve the inability
to attain and then maintain the physiological arousal. For a woman, this includes vasocongestion in the pelvis, vaginal lubrication and expansion, and
swelling of the external genitalia. For the male, it involves the ability to maintain until completion an adequate erection. (It should be noted that what is
Why People Become Patients 133
“adequate” is a debatable point. An individual male might view his erection is
not adequate, yet it allows for genital-genital sex without difficulty.) Another
point to consider is that the use of medications such as Viagra, Levitra, and
Cialis can treat erectile dysfunction rather easily. In this case, the disorder is
said to be in remission. Another consideration is that erectile dysfunction could
be a sign of atherosclerosis and may signal a need for a medical evaluation.
Orgasmic Disorders are difficult to assess. They may relate to age, health,
sexual experience, and sexual stimulation. The disorder may manifest as delay
in, or absence of an orgasm as part of the sexual activity.
Premature Ejaculation, like other sexual disorders, is difficult to identify.
How much time should elapse before the male reaches orgasm? Partner estimates often vary widely. Key ingredients involve whether the ejaculation occurs sooner than the individual or partner desires it. It may relate to factors
during the excitement phase, novelty of the experience, sexual experience of
the individual, and recency or frequency of sexual activity.
Sexual Pain Disorders such as Dyspareunia that is not due to a medical
condition can occur in both males and females and involves pain before, during, and after intercourse.
Vaginismus that is not due to medical condition involves a persistent and
recurrent involuntary contraction of the perineal muscles surrounding the
outer third of the vagina. This will cause pain and difficulty in intercourse or in
inserting a tampon.
Finally, sexual dysfunction can be related to the use of a substance, especially when intoxication is involved.
Paraphilias span a spectrum of behavior; Exhibitionism (the exposure of
genitals), Fetishism (the sexual arousal involves nonhuman objects, e.g., shoes,
underwear), Frotteurism (rubbing against or touching a nonconsenting person), and Pedophilia (a sexual focus on children). The definition of child in one
state may differ in another, but the general rule is that pedophilia involves prepubertal children. Paraphilia also includes Sexual Masochism (receiving humiliation and pain), Sexual Sadism (inflicting humiliation and pain on another),
Transvestic Fetishism (cross-dressing); (this is also debatable inasmuch as the
wearing of the clothes of another gender may be acceptable in specific circumstances), and Voyeurism (the observation of the sexual activity of another). The
common thread for the paraphilias is that the individual has recurrent and intense sexual fantasies, urges, and actions that may involve nonhuman objects,
the suffering and humiliation of another person, or sexual involvement with
children or nonconsenting adults. In many cases, paraphiliac actions are considered criminal acts and may result in arrest and prosecution.
Society has allowed expression for some paraphilias. Peep shows and
pornography allow the individual to observe others involved in sexual activity.
Transvestism may be acceptable in private or in certain places or venues in
many cities. A masochistic individual may seek humiliation and pay a great deal
of money for it. Pedophilia, however, is banned and severely prosecuted in
every state. In most cases, excepting those sexual behaviors that hurt or impact
on others, the behavior must cause distress to the individual.
Gender Identity Disorders must have two components. The first is that these
individuals must evidence a strong and persistent cross-gender identification to
134 Introduction
be (or to insist that they are) of the other gender. The second component is that
they are uncomfortable with their gender or believe that their gender is inappropriate. In many cases, sexual reassignment is done. This involves extensive assessment, medical evaluation, behavioral training, and social skills training to help
the individuals fit into their desired gender role.
Eating Disorders
Eating disorders include Anorexia Nervosa, Bulimia, and Binge Eating Disorder.
Anorexia Nervosa involves a refusal to maintain body weight at or above a minimally normal weight for one’s age and height (e.g., weight loss leading to maintenance of body weight less than 85% of that expected; or failure to make expected
weight gain during period of growth, leading to body weight less than 85% of
that expected). There is also an intense fear of gaining weight or becoming fat,
even though the individual may be medically compromised because of being underweight. There is also a disturbance in the way in which one’s body weight or
shape is experienced The individual uses body weight or shape to maintain a positive self-evaluation. Even when there is medical necessity to gain weight, the seriousness of the current low body weight may be vehemently denied.
In Bulimia Nervosa, the person has regularly engaged in binges of eating
and purges (self-induced vomiting or the misuse of laxatives, diuretics, or enemas). First, recurrent episodes of binge eating involve eating in a discrete period of time (e.g., within any 2-hour period), an amount of food that is larger
than most people would eat during a similar period and under similar circumstances. Second, the individual experiences lack of control over eating during
the episode (e.g., a feeling that one cannot stop eating or control what or how
much one is eating). The individual may then engage in self-induced vomiting;
misuse of laxatives, diuretics, enemas, or other medications; fasting; or excessive exercise, all to avoid weight gain. As with anorexia, the individual’s selfevaluation is influenced by perceived body shape and weight.
A third category of eating disorder is Binge Eating Disorder. The individual
eats large amounts of food in a concentrated period of time, but without purging,
enemas, or laxatives. This behavior may lead to extensive weight gain and obesity.
Primary Sleep Disorders (Dyssomnias)
These disorders include Primary Insomnia, Primary Hypersomnia, Narcolepsy,
Breathing-Related Sleep Disorder, Circadian Rhythm Sleep Disorder, Nightmare Disorder, Sleep Terror Disorder, and Sleepwalking Disorder.
Dyssomnias involve a disturbance in the amount, quality, or timing of
sleep. In Primary Insomnia, there is a problem initiating or maintaining sleep.
There may be problems in falling asleep, middle-of-the-night waking, or waking up well before one needs to in the morning. In Primary Hypersomnia, the
individual experiences excessive sleepiness, prolonged sleep episodes, or daytime sleep episodes daily. The assumption is made that the Hypersomnia is not
reactive to studying late, an extreme party experience, or the use of substances.
The person with Narcolepsy experiences “irresistible attacks of refreshing
sleep” (DSM-IV-TR, p. 567). In the middle of a conversation, the individual may
Why People Become Patients 135
show an eye flutter, a head drop, and fall asleep. While the consequences are
limited when sitting in a chair at home, driving can become a lethal activity for
the individual and anyone else on the road.
Breathing-related sleep disorder involves the disruption of restful sleep
because of breathing difficulty, for example, sleep apnea which involves an obstruction of the airway. The most common complaints are from the individual
who reports sleepiness the next day, and from sleep partners who have to deal
with loud snoring, interruptions in breathing, and snorting.
Circadian Rhythm Sleep Disorder involves a disruption in the sleepwake cycle. It could be brought on by jet lag or changing shift work. The
individual experiences sleepiness until his or her body adjusts to the new
sleep-wake cycle.
Nightmare Disorder creates a situation wherein the individual has
episodes of waking from a deep sleep with detailed memories of frightening
dreams. Sleep Terror Disorder is similar in that it involves abrupt waking from
sleep, but without the detailed memory of a dream, only the autonomic arousal
experienced during fear and danger.
In the midst of a Sleepwalking Disorder experience, individuals will rise
from their bed, walk about, and even involve themselves in activity, for example, eating. They can be awakened with difficulty, and they do not, as the myth
has it, die if you wake them.
Impulse Control Disorders
Impulse-Control Disorders include Intermittent Explosive Disorder (discrete
episodes of assault or destruction of property that must be differentiated
from other antisocial behavior, manic behavior, or conduct disorder), Kleptomania (failure to resist impulsive stealing or taking of property that belongs to
someone else), Pyromania (setting fires to achieve gratification, pleasure, or
a relief of tension), Pathological Gambling (persistent and pathological gambling that causes personal and relationship distress), and Trichotillomania
(pulling out of one’s own hair to achieve gratification, pleasure, or a relief of
tension).
Adjustment Disorders
Adjustment Disorders involve difficulty dealing with and adapting to specific
life stressors and circumstances. They require the development of emotional or
behavioral symptoms in response to an identifiable stressor(s) occurring within
3 months of the onset of the stressor(s). The manifestation of the adjustment
difficulty is marked by distress that exceeds what would typically be expected
from exposure to the stressor, causes significant impairment in social or occupational (academic) functioning, and the stress-related disturbance does not
meet the criteria for another specific Axis I disorder, nor is it merely an exacerbation of a preexisting Axis I or Axis II disorder.
Once the stressor (or its consequences) has terminated, the symptoms do
not persist for more than an additional 6 months. However, some stressors are
chronic or unremitting, for example, disabling physical injury.
136 Introduction
Personality Disorders
Personality disorders, by definition, are inflexible, pervasive, stable, and enduring, and lead to clinically significant distress or impairment in functioning
(American Psychiatric Association, 2000). They typically manifest in early
adulthood although the prodromal symptoms may appear much earlier.
Individuals with PD are typically unaware of the extent of their problems
despite the sometimes overwhelming effects of their behaviors on themselves
and those around them. For many individuals, their patterns of thinking, feeling, and relating seem comfortable and familiar. It is very often the family,
friends, or coworkers of the individual with a personality disorder who find the
person’s patterns particularly troublesome. It is estimated that approximately
1% to 3% of the general population has a diagnosable personality disorder
(APA, 2000a). Many more individuals may suffer from subclinical levels of
character pathology. No two patients typically present with the exact same
combination of diagnostic criteria.
Some patients are superficially aware of the self-defeating nature of their
personality problems (e.g., overdependence, inhibition, excessive avoidance)
but are impotent in changing their behavior. Still other patients may recognize
their maladaptive behavioral patterns and have the motivation to change them,
but just do not have the skills to make it happen.
Axis II problems are not always diagnosed at treatment intake, though
early diagnosis and treatment planning are likely to be more effective. Many
Axis II patients are silent about their personality problems, or deny them, as a
reflection of the disorders.
The DSM has divided the personality disorders into three groups or clusters. Each cluster has a unifying theme that is overarching for the component
disorders.
Cluster A: Paranoid, Schizoid, and Schizotypal
The DSM-IV-TR describes this cluster as the odd or eccentric cluster (APA, 2000a).
Individuals with Cluster A personality disorders are less likely than other clusters to present for treatment. The relative lack of discomfort regarding their
experience may make it difficult for them to find the need or motivation to
change. Because they tend to prefer solitary activities, they may have fewer familial or social contacts encouraging (or pressuring) them to seek assistance.
The very nature of Paranoid Personality Disorder, is a suspicion of others,
which naturally extends to any potential therapeutic relationship, thereby impeding potential assistance. The schizotypal individual is uncomfortable with
others and may experience great distress in social situations. What is interesting is that this group is similar in style, though not degree to individuals with
schizophrenia. Schizotypal individuals have ideas of reference (incorrect interpretations of casual events as having special meaning for the individual). This
is differentiated from the schizophrenic individual who has delusions of reference that are far more strongly held and believed. Particular attention in the
assessment phase should be made with regard to the pervasiveness of the phenomenon, especially in the absence of overt psychotic phenomena, including
hallucinations.
Why People Become Patients 137
Cluster B: Antisocial, Borderline, Histrionic, and Narcissistic
The DSM-IV-TR defines this cluster as the dramatic and erratic cluster (APA,
2000a). Individuals with Cluster B personality disorders are frequently seen in
both inpatient and outpatient settings. Their manifestations are fairly easily detected and can be particularly dangerous (self-destructive or risk-taking).
These clients may be erratic and impulsive, and demonstrate a high potential
for harm to self or others.
Cluster C: Avoidant, Dependent, and Obsessive-Compulsive
The DSM-IV-TR describes Cluster C personality disorders as anxious and avoidant
(APA, 2000a). Some of the manifestations of Cluster C disorders are socially
desirable in moderation (e.g., learning to depend on others). In excess, however, they can cripple an individual.
Finally, there are problems that are common and often linked to normal
stresses and tensions in living. These include Relational Problems including Relational Problem Related to a Mental Disorder or General Medical Condition,
Parent-Child Relational Problems, Partner Relational Problems, and Sibling Relational Problems.
Problems related to abuse and neglect include the Physical Abuse of Child,
Sexual Abuse of Child, Neglect of a Child, Physical Abuse of Adult, including
partner physical abuse, and Sexual Abuse of an Adult.
Summary
As you can see by this thorough nomenclature, the classification of mental
disorders is a complex and difficult process. There are no easy answers, and
there are many disagreements about the current diagnostic schema. This system is, in fact, in the process of revision. The revisions will include possible
new categories, revision of older diagnoses, and alteration of certain diagnostic criteria to better reflect the empirical data, respond to social changes, add
new Axes, and make the diagnostic process easier for the clinician. It remains
to be seen whether greater detail and complexit


This chapter begins the focus on assessment in all aspects of clinical psychology. Different types of assessment have different goals, and these
purposes are articulated. Consideration is given to differences when assessments are geared toward direct service to patients, in consultation to other
professionals, and to answer specific clinical questions or monitor clinical progress. The biopsychosocial systems model is put forth as a comprehensive, integrative view of human behavior that frames assessment to be individualized,
yet inclusive.
Learning Objectives
At the end of this chapter, the reader should be able to:
• Articulate at least three goals for clinical assessment.
• Describe the purpose for conducting at least three types of assessment
(cognitive assessment, personality assessment, and behavioral assessment).
• Explain the biopsychosocial systems model of understanding human behavior and why this multifaceted approach is critical to understanding
similarities and differences among people.
• Explain the role of biology, cognitions, behaviors, affect, social factors,
cultural factors, spiritual beliefs, and physical environment, in understanding how people think and behave.
• Provide an example of how assessing the biopsychosocial systems domains
of a person results in a comprehensive understanding of human behavior.
142 Basic Techniques for Clinicians—Assessment
When you got dressed this morning, how did you choose your clothing? If
you are like most people, you thought about the temperature outside, where
you were planning to go today, whom you expected to see, and the clothes you
had available from which to choose. In essence, you made an assessment of your
clothing situation based on information you gathered from your environment;
your mood, thoughts, and feelings; and your goals for the day. The sociocultural
context within which you live also played a role in this decision by giving you
a sense of what type of clothing is acceptable or permitted in society or in the
situations you planned to encounter. In the most basic sense of the term, people make numerous assessments to navigate their way through day-to-day decisions, even if they are not cognizant of these decisions. Similarly, assessment is
a core component of all aspects of clinical psychology.
Researchers, administrators, clinicians, professors, and other practitioners
of clinical psychology use assessment as the foundation for everything they do.
Psychologists must evaluate psychological phenomena before initiating further
scientific investigation, before making changes in clinic or academic programs,
or before initiating therapy with clients. Graduate programs in clinical psychology provide students with knowledge and skills that qualify them to conduct,
administer, and interpret certain types of tests and assessments. This training
often distinguishes mental health professionals with graduate training in psychology from colleagues (social workers, special education teachers, psychiatrists, nurses) who are not prepared with a graduate psychology degree. Thus,
learning about assessment tools, techniques, processes, and ways to approach
assessment is critical for newly developing psychology professionals.
This chapter presents a psychological assessment paradigm that is based on
cognitive and behavioral principles, and behavioral assessment, broadly defined.
Behavioral assessment was defined by O’Leary and Wilson (1975) as “an attempt to identify the environmental and self-imposed variables which are currently (original authors’ emphasis) maintaining an individual’s maladaptive
thoughts, feelings, and behaviors . . .” (pp. 18–19). Although “behavioral assessment” has been defined in various ways (Cone, 1998), the O’Leary and Wilson
definition is most widely accepted (Silva, 1993). The goals of various types of
assessment, and the most common data collection strategies and techniques
used by clinical psychologists are introduced in this chapter. The biopsychosocial
systems model and a scientific approach to assessment (in Chapter 7) are provided as the conceptual frameworks in which to gather clinically useful information. Lastly, the clinical decision-making model (A. M. Nezu & Nezu, 1989;
A. M. Nezu, Nezu, Friedman, & Haynes, 1997) is described in Chapter 8 as a
structure for clinicians’ to use in planning and conducting clinical assessments.
Goals of Assessment
There are many reasons for conducting a psychological assessment, and each
reason requires the assessor to initiate different tasks. Likewise, selecting methods and techniques for acquiring clinical information depends on the nature
and function of the assessment. Therefore, before learning how to conduct an
Introduction to Assessment 143
assessment, practitioners of clinical psychology must understand why or for
what purpose assessments are conducted.
In general, the major aims of assessments are to gather information about
persons, systems, environments, or phenomenon (or some combination of
these), and to enable classification, description, and comprehension or evaluation of
current circumstances. Assessments also may be directed to predict future behaviors (dangerousness, suicide) or circumstances (maintaining employment).
Commonly, assessments seek to respond to more than one of these goals at a
time and can be tailored to address several clinical or research questions.
Therefore, you will notice overlap among the strategies and techniques used for
collecting information for each purpose.
Diagnostic Assessment
The purpose of diagnostic assessment is to differentiate between “normal” and
“abnormal” behavior, to differentiate among various “abnormal” constellations
of symptoms, and to classify individuals based on identified abnormalities or
“presentation of disease” (Chaplin, 1985). Questions that diagnostic assessments can answer include the following examples. A 6-year-old child is having
trouble in school, and not staying in his seat during lessons: Does the child have
an attention deficit disorder, an anxiety disorder, or conduct disorder? A 68-
year-old female has been increasingly forgetful, less energetic, and confused: Is
she depressed or suffering from the onset of dementia? Why is the 35-year-oldmale having chest pains and rapid heart rates without any biological explanation for these symptoms? Answering such questions through diagnostic
assessments may lead to recommendations for treatment, establishment of the
clients’ eligibility (or ineligibility) for disability services (e.g., disability accommodations, reimbursement from insurance companies), or simply increased
understanding of patients’ symptoms, which will enable other health care practitioners to work more effectively with them.
Diagnostic assessments in a psychological setting are similar in concept to
physicians’ medical examinations. Medical patients arrive in physicians’ offices
for many reasons. Depending on the motivation for the visit, physicians either
focus on a specific complaint presented by the patient, or may evaluate the entire person in the search for “what’s wrong?” There is a clear mission to search
for abnormality or pathology, identify the malady, and report the findings. Typically, such an examination would lead to treatment if a disease or abnormality
were found. Seldom does a physician examine a patient only to identify optimal functioning; information is typically a by-product of the diagnostic or physical examination. Similarly, diagnostic psychological assessments tend to be
“disease” focused and are criticized (Follette & Hayes, 1992) for following a
deficit model, rather than a balanced model of strengths and deficits. Furthermore, behavioral and cognitive-behavioral psychologists (Follette, 1996, 1997)
criticize diagnostic assessments for excluding contextual information about antecedents, consequences, and social, physical, and cultural environmental factors from the evaluation of persons’ reported problems and symptoms.
Partially, this phenomenon is a function of the classification systems that guide
diagnostic evaluations.
144 Basic Techniques for Clinicians—Assessment
Classification Systems
The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (4th Edition; DSM-IV-TR;
American Psychiatric Association, 2000) is the guide most commonly used by
mental health professionals in the United States for diagnosing psychological,
psychosocial, interpersonal and environmental problems in children, adolescents, and adults. The International Classification of Disorders-10 (ICD-10; WHO,
1992) is also used worldwide, and is the preferred classification system by
physicians.
Classification systems, as the basis for diagnostic assessments, are derived
from enormous amounts of research on very large samples of the population.
Their purpose is to provide nomothetic information. Nomothetic information is
information that establishes general principles, norms, or laws. With regard to
the DSM-IV-TR (American Psychiatric Association, 2000) or ICD-10 (WHO,
1992), nomothetic information informs us how many people with certain characteristics, features, or symptoms may behave, interact with others, or reportedly feel about themselves, others, and the world around them. The information
differentiates persons with such characteristics, features, or symptoms from
data collected on large volumes of “normal” people, or individuals who do not
have difficulty in personal, social, occupational, or academic functioning.
For example, we know that many adults with major depressive disorders
often have persistent feelings of extreme hopelessness about their future, and
they have felt this way for an extended period (2 weeks or more; American
Psychiatric Association, 2000). Nondepressed, normal persons, while in a temporary negative mood state, may endorse intermittent feelings of hopelessness
about specific situations or momentary feelings of hopelessness about their futures, but they do not typically report enduring feelings of hopelessness under
ordinary circumstances. It is important to remember, however, that information in the DSM-IV-TR and ICD-10 is based on average scores and commonalities
in self-reports or evaluations, and that there are variations within the group
and exceptions to the rules and criteria established. Therefore, not all persons
who meet criteria for a Major Depressive Disorder will endorse having persistent feelings of hopelessness, but they will likely overlap with the majority
group in other symptomatology.
The classification systems continue to evolve in accordance with the development in the fields of clinical and social psychology, anthropology, and epidemiology. The DSM-IV-TR is revised periodically to include information about
populations and variables that had been underrepresented in the past. In the
most recent revision, the task forces in charge of improving on the DSM-IV-TR
have increased attention to diversity and cultural factors and strive to increase
understanding and classification of patterns of symptoms that may warrant a
diagnosis or specific nomenclature in future additions.
Diagnostic manuals have significant merits and have allowed for a certain
degree of standardization in the field of clinical psychology. They provide a
means for professionals to communicate about clients or patients, and disseminate synthesized conclusions from volumes of research. Psychologists gear diagnostic assessments, in part, to seek confirmation or disconfirmation of persons’
fit with nomothetic information. The DSM-IV-TR provides a starting point for
understanding clients’ clinical presentations and for determining general directions for treatment planning. However, to solely rely on nomothetic information
Introduction to Assessment 145
would be equivalent to taking a cookbook approach to identifying persons’
problems and solutions to their problems. As you know from your own experience with others, and from reading Chapter 5 of this book, people are much
more complex! Relying on group norms and typical or common presentations
would be misleading in diagnosis and treatment. Psychologists also have an ethical obligation to consider personal characteristics of individuals assessed to ensure tests are valid for the person tested, interpretation of data is appropriate,
and recommendations based on test data are culturally and individually relevant (APA, 2003, 9.0). As such, nomothetic information is balanced and integrated with ideographic (individual) information. Ideographic assessments are
characteristic of behavioral assessments, and are defined and discussed in more
detail later in this chapter.
Logistics and Details of Diagnostic Assessments
Mental health professionals who have training and experience using the DSMIV-TR or ICD-10, and specialized measures, inventories, or structured interviews
use these tools to conduct diagnostic assessments for a variety of purposes. The
APA Ethical Principles and Code of Conduct (APA, 2003) specifies that only
trained qualified individuals should use psychological tests, and outlines the
cautions to be taken. Clients or family members of clients might request a diagnostic assessment. Clinicians routinely incorporate diagnostic assessments into
their standard practices for evaluating new clients for treatment planning. Nonmental health professional colleagues (medical professionals, school administrators, teachers), or mental health professionals who desire more precise
understanding of their patients’ presentations of symptoms may request consultation with professionals trained to conduct diagnostic assessments. Diagnostic
assessments may also be conducted to screen, classify, or assign individuals for
clinical research studies according to the information obtained. Likewise, forensic psychologists may conduct diagnostic assessments to determine clients’ mental competencies to stand trial or mental states related to committed crimes.
Depending on the complexity of the client’s presentation of symptoms, a
diagnostic assessment may be accomplished through interviewing alone, or
may require interviewing in combination with other tests and measurements.
A diagnostic assessment may be one component of a comprehensive evaluation
of an individual, or it may be the sole purpose of an assessment. Although diagnostic assessments may be repeated over time to determine whether temporal
symptoms have been alleviated, certain diagnoses are considered unremitting,
lifelong conditions (antisocial personality disorder, borderline personality disorder, narcissistic personality disorders; A. T. Beck, Freeman, Davis, & Associates, 2004), and therefore, reevaluation may not occur. Unlike some forms of
behavioral assessment, practitioners may conduct diagnostic assessments in almost any setting in which they work. These evaluations are not dependent on
viewing clients in their naturalistic environments.
Clinical Examples
EXAMPLE 1 For a client who is self-referred to a psychologist specializing in
sleep disorders, a diagnostic assessment is necessary to determine if the client
indeed has a sleep disorder, and if so, what kind; or to determine if the sleep
difficulties are secondary to other medical or psychological problems. Once the
146 Basic Techniques for Clinicians—Assessment
psychologist determines the nature of the client’s difficulty, treatment interventions may be offered, or an appropriate referral made if the sleep difficulties
are determined to be secondary to another psychological or medical problem.
EXAMPLE 2 Ms. Latte requested an evaluation to determine if she had an Attention Deficit Disorder. Ms. Latte saw a special program on television, and
recognized that troubles she had learned to live with and work around were
consistent with those of the televised woman with this reported diagnosis.
Ms. Latte was functioning reasonably well, but has always felt “alone” in her
problems, and “embarrassed” for being “scatterbrained” and distractible. Her
goal for the assessment was simply to identify if her history and current patterns of behavior were consistent with this diagnosis. She believed that gaining this information would allow her to alleviate some of her self-deprecating
thoughts and hard feelings, help her husband understand that her problems
were not volitional, and possibly gain recommendations for improving her
daily functioning.
EXAMPLE 3 In psychiatric emergency rooms, psychologists may conduct diagnostic assessments to determine patients’ needed level of care, and to communicate this information to triage facilities (inpatient unit, partial program, or
outpatient clinic) before discharging or admitting patients to other units for follow-up care.
EXAMPLE 4 If someone you know told you that her child has a reading disability, would you know how to help your friend assess the services that her child
needs? Most professionals would need more specific information to develop
recommendations or a treatment plan. For starters, what are the child’s current
learning strengths and difficulties, environmental supports, learning strategies
used, individual and family expectations, and self-efficacy beliefs? Note that
you can ethically help a friend consider services that might be appropriate for a
particular disorder, but you cannot ethically give recommendations or treatment plans on a casual basis to personal friends and acquaintances. Assessments, just like therapy, must always be conducted within the boundaries of a
formal professional relationship (see APA, 2002, 3.05, 3.06, 9.01).
Descriptive Assessments
Descriptive assessments, broadly described, are conducted to learn more about
clients’ cognitive functioning, psychosocial functioning, academic achievement, personality, behavior, or specific needs within an identified area of
interest (e.g., caregivers’ needs). Assessment questions may focus on individuals, families, groups of people (e.g., group home setting; hospital unit), or
person-environment interactions (e.g., goodness of fit between a developmentally disabled adult and her social rehabilitation program setting). Mental
health professionals conduct these assessments to obtain background and general information necessary for better understanding of clients’ problems and
factors contributing to those problems. Such assessments aid professionals in
planning treatment, providing academic or occupational counseling, and de-
Introduction to Assessment 147
signing group or individual behavior modification interventions. Researchers
or program evaluators may use descriptive assessments to provide end-users of
their work with information about populations or programs under study.
Descriptive assessments are often combined with diagnostic assessments,
and some methods of evaluation will accomplish data collection for both purposes. Data collection techniques for descriptive assessments include a combination of interviews, observation, self-report inventories and questionnaires,
reports by others, computerized assessment, and physiological assessment.
Clinical psychologists with proper training can conduct most types of descriptive assessments. Psychologists also commonly specialize in assessments for
specific aged populations (e.g., children/adolescents, adults, senior adults), disorders (e.g., learning disabilities, traumatic brain injury, Huntington’s chorea)
or psychosocial problems (e.g., court-adjudicated offenders).
Prediction Assessments
While evaluation of current functioning is critical to most types of assessment,
under certain circumstances, psychologists are also asked or required to predict
clients’ future behaviors or the effect or impact that situations or life events
will have on individuals’ thoughts, feelings, behaviors, or overall functioning.
Predictive assessments are often necessary in or for medical, forensic, and occupational settings, and traditional mental health in- and outpatient settings.
Given the uniqueness of individuals, and the inconsistency of behaviors characteristic of persons with certain personality disorders or other problems, most
predictive assessments remain tentative and qualified as “best estimations.”
The accuracy of any assessment, but especially of predictive assessments, relies
on the availability, accuracy, and reliability of data about the predictor and predicted variables (Haynes & O’Brien, 2000). Predictor variables are those factors
that are presumed to precede or co-occur with the behavior to be predicted,
and to be causally related in some way.
Some behaviors are more easily predictable than others. Assuming we
have comprehensive information leading to the diagnosis, it is likely that a
young adult with social anxiety, without treatment, will have difficulty delivering his 30-minute presentation to the 75 students in his college course; an
older adult who had little social support other than her recently deceased
spouse, who also has a history of poor coping skills, may be likely to have difficulty adjusting to widowhood, and may suffer from complicated bereavement.
Such predictions are fairly easy to make, given a thorough assessment of past
behavior, current functioning, and other psychosocial variables, and the predictable nature of the behaviors in question.
When more difficult predictions of future behavior are requested or necessary, significant consequences may be associated with the outcome of the
evaluation. For example, predictions of suicide risk, dangerousness, psychological suitability for specific medical treatments, or prediction of psychological
preparedness for parenthood (adoption) require psychologists to gain as much
certainty as possible, since the consequences related to poor or inadequate assessment can obviously be grave. The APA Code of Ethics (APA, 2003, 9.01)
cautions that predictions or recommendations made based on assessments
148 Basic Techniques for Clinicians—Assessment
should specify the sources of data collected and that for mandated individuals
specifically (and all others, generally), appropriate informed consent must be
obtained (9.03). Some examples of prediction assessments will illustrate the
complexities of this work.
Psychologists working in almost any clinical setting will be faced with the
need to conduct suicide and dangerousness risk assessments. Current suicide
symptoms and homicidal ideation are standard components of most psychologists’ intake assessment and mental status examination. When clients endorse
suicidal or homicidal ideation (thoughts), further evaluation is necessary to determine the severity of these thoughts, the clients’ likelihood of acting on these
thoughts and plans to do so, and their ability or access to the means by which
they could execute their plans. Based on thorough assessments, clinical psychologists are expected to make predictions about a client’s safety and the
safety of others, before they can release the client from their presence. However, Rudd and Joiner (1998) emphasize that although the court system seems
to imply that clinicians should be able to predict suicide, empirical data show
that “prediction” models of suicide consistently fail (see Rudd & Joiner for references to these studies); therefore, the complexity of this task cannot be overstated. Based on research reviewed by Rudd and Joiner, clinicians’ “risk”
assessments (focusing on patients’ current state) are more accurate and reliable
than actual predictions (implying future behavior) of suicide attempts or completion. Risk assessment for suicide consists of evaluation of predisposing factors (e.g., age, sex, previous psychiatric diagnosis, history of suicidality), acute
and chronic risk factors and precipitating factors (current stressors or losses,
such as job, loved ones, physical or cognitive ability, chronic pain, affective disorders, poor problem-solving skills, social isolation, poor impulse control), and
protective factors (active involvement in treatment, good physical health, good
problem-solving ability, social support, hopefulness; see Rudd & Joiner for a
complete review of references).
In medical settings, physicians constantly make decisions and predictions
about patients’ likely physical response to medications, medical interventions
(e.g., surgery, radiation, organ transplantation), and treatments (e.g., light
therapy). However, many physicians recognize that biological responses are not
the only concern. Patients’ compliance with medical regimens and ability to
cope with necessary lifestyle and behavioral changes can be equally important.
Clinical (or clinical health) psychologists aid physicians’ decision making and
treatment planning for patients by conducting predictive assessments relating
to these issues.
For example, organ transplant recipients must comply with medication
and behavioral (bone marrow transplant recipients must stay away from
crowds for 6 months to 1 year, due to low immune functioning) regimens following transplants. Many recipients take as many as 5 to 10 medications following the transplant, including anti-rejection medications to prevent their
bodies from rejecting the new organ. If patients do not comply with this requirement, fatal consequences could result. Physicians, therefore, want to be
as certain as possible that treatment is truly in an individual’s best interest.
Likewise, individuals with histories of drug or alcohol abuse may be questionable candidates for some medical treatments because of the potential for them
to cope poorly with the short- or long-term effects of treatment, and the
Introduction to Assessment 149
lethality of mixing alcohol or drugs with the prescribed regimen they may be
given. Psychologists must assess patients’ past behaviors, current functioning
(emotional state, desire or motivation for treatment, coping skills), psychosocial resources (strength in faith or spirituality, social support), and other factors, to evaluate the strengths and potential threats or weaknesses that can
impact future behavior.
Psychologists working in forensic settings are likely to conduct predictive
assessments for various reasons. For offender populations, prediction of recidivism is likely required as part of court system procedures relating to sentencing
and parole, and defendant- and plaintiff-initiated evaluations. Family/marital
lawyers also frequently hire clinical and forensic psychologists to evaluate
clients’ current functioning (descriptive assessment or diagnostic assessment),
and predict future behaviors. Behaviors of interest in family/marital law might
include clients’ likelihood of future abusive behaviors; clients’ future abilities to
manage anger and aggression if rehabilitation is sought; clients’ likelihood of
complying with child custody mandates and abilities to maintain effective parenting skills, and children’s predicted responses to custody arrangements. Numerous other examples exist.
Occupational settings provide rich opportunities for psychological assessment. Questions to be answered in occupational settings may relate to the
workforce in a company as a whole, or individuals within a workforce. Prediction assessments might be sought to answer questions such as the following
ones: What is the likelihood of this employee’s occupational success, given the
specific accommodations and training available? What variables are predictive
of burnout in persons with a particular job or position (Mack, 2004; Schober &
Felgoise, 2002)? What is the likely psychological impact of a specified corporate
change on upper-level management? Psychologists working in employee assistance programs may conduct more traditional clinical prediction assessments.
Review
Psychological assessments generally seek to classify, describe, or predict clients’
psychological functioning and behaviors. Many referral or assessment questions require evaluations structured to accomplish more than one of these
goals. Clinical psychologists conduct assessments in various settings, assuming
various roles (e.g., consultant, health care team, independent practitioner).
Thus far, descriptions and examples of the goals and types of assessments clinical psychologists conduct have remained general. The following section describes several specific types of assessment that are conducted to answer
specific questions.
Specific Types of Assessment
To differentiate among the different types of assessment, several key questions
are answered within each of the following subsections to address the elements
of what, when, who, where, why, and how. What are the goals of the assessment? When, relative to other life events, will the assessment take place? Who
150 Basic Techniques for Clinicians—Assessment
requests the evaluation or who refers clients for specific assessments? Who is
(are) the person(s) to be evaluated? Where will the assessment be conducted?
Why is the assessment necessary? How will the information be used? The answers to these questions vary depending on the assessment prescribed. Some
overlap is also noted as the different applications of assessment are illustrated.
Although classifying an individual as mentally retarded may be useful for
communicating a person’s general functioning level among professionals, describing the person’s strengths, weaknesses, likes and dislikes, will be equally or
more important in the development of a behavior modification plan.
Cognitive Assessment
Cognitive assessment focuses on understanding brain-behavior relationships,
information processing, and thinking skills. The following critical aspects of
cognition may be targeted for assessment: attention, perception, memory,
schemas, learning (intelligence; achievement; aptitude), cognitive development, creativity, language, problem solving, decision making, and judgment.
Neuropsychological tests, intelligence tests, achievement and aptitude tests,
and development tests are specific types of cognitive assessments for evaluating
these areas.
Clinicians who conduct or request cognitive assessments are interested
in understanding individuals’ skills (strengths and deficits), abilities, and limits, and comparing these skills and abilities with clients’ own displayed affect
and behaviors. Individuals’ functioning is usually compared with their own
previous or prospective functioning, to normative standards predetermined by
research, or both. Some high schools require youth football players (and other
sports participants) to have cognitive assessments prior to beginning the football season. These baseline assessments provide individual norms that are
later used for comparison with postinjury (concussions) cognitive assessments if football players are hurt during the season. Cognitive assessments
may be conducted periodically to evaluate positive or negative change over
time, such as yearly achievement testing in language development or mathematics skills. Intelligence testing exemplifies an assessment done to evaluate
individuals’ functioning compared with normative standards: parents may request IQ (intelligence quotient) testing to determine children’s scholastic
needs and readiness to begin elementary school, or later in life for psychoeducational planning.
Other reasons cognitive assessments may be indicated are numerous.
Cognitive assessments may be required when persons are not reaching expected developmental milestones, such as language skills. Self-recognition or
by others of nonnormative (nonaverage) behavior, either positive (superior intellectual abilities, creativity), or negative (attention problems, extreme emotional lability), often generates referrals for cognitive assessment. Significant
changes in cognitive functioning are usually noticed by individuals, family,
and friends, and often lead to visits to primary care physicians or emergency
rooms; these health professionals may require psychologists’ assistance in diagnosing or understanding the cause for the behavior change (Rozensky,
Sweet, & Tovian, 1997). Such sudden or gradual behavior changes may have
Introduction to Assessment 151
resulted from a known external event (accident), or a known or initially unknown biological change (tumor, medication side-effects, aging process).
Thus, as these examples demonstrate, cognitive assessments are useful for individuals across the life span, for purposes of diagnosis, understanding, and
treatment or future planning.
Intellectual Assessments and Intelligence Tests
Although intelligence tests are technically encompassed by discussion of cognitive assessments, their popularity warrants more detailed description. Numerous experts have defined intelligence in various ways, and history dating back to
the 1800s reveals the development and controversy over the concept of intelligence and its measurement (see Sternberg, 1999, pp. 470–477 for a review).
According to Sternberg’s (1999) review of a more recent study (Sternberg &
Detterman, 1986), the consensus definition of intelligence among 24 cognitive
psychologists with expertise in intelligence research is as follows: “the capacity
to learn from experience, using metacognitive processes to enhance learning,
and the ability to adapt to the surrounding environment, which may require
different adaptations within different social and cultural contexts” (p. 469).
Thus, there are basic components of intelligence that are germane to all people,
and also unique considerations that must be made for persons of different gender, culture, race, and advantaged or disadvantaged backgrounds.
Intellectual assessments, and the tests used to conduct them, are among
the most commonly thought of psychological tests among nonpsychologists.
School psychologists, counseling psychologists, and clinical psychologists all use
intelligence tests for a variety of purposes, but most often for educational and
vocational planning (for persons with intellectual disabilities or giftedness), and
as a part of general cognitive assessment (see previous examples). At one time
or another, you may have been given a version of a standardized intelligence test
such as a Wechsler Preschool and Primary Scale of Intelligence—Revised (for
ages 3 to 7, WPPSI-R; Wechsler, 1989), Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children—Third Edition (for ages 6 through 16; WISC-III; Wechsler, 1991), Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale-III (for ages 16 through 89; WAIS-III; Psychological
Corporation, 1997; Wechsler, 1997), or the Stanford-Binet Intelligence Scales
(Fourth Edition; Thorndike, Hagen, & Sattler, 1986). The Wechsler scales are the
most popular intellectual assessment tools in use, followed by the StanfordBinet Scales. Nonverbal intellectual tests, such as the General Ability Measure
for Adults (GAMA), also exist to assess intellectual functioning in individuals
with minimal to no English language ability, such as individuals with limited
formal education, those who are deaf or hearing impaired, or who are from nonEnglish speaking cultures (Bardos, 2001). The GAMA is purported to be free of
bias from expressive language skills and overall academic achievement.
David Wechsler, developer of the Wechsler Scales, believed intelligence
comprises cognitive, affective, and motivational factors (Ryan & Lopez, 2001).
As such, he created the Wechsler Scales based on items and measures selected
from existing ability tests (see Ryan & Lopez for review). The results of the
WAIS-III, WISC-III, and previous versions of these tests (WAIS, WAIS-R, WISC,
WISC-R) provide three separate intelligence quotient scores: Verbal IQ, Performance IQ, and the Full Scale IQ, which is an overall quotient of abilities. The
152 Basic Techniques for Clinicians—Assessment
raw scores for these tests are converted into standardized/scaled scores to enable comparison of individual scores with normative scores, according to age.
The scaled scores are then summed and converted to IQ scores, which can be
compared across age, regardless of which Wechsler IQ score was used to arrive
at the IQ results. Psychologists also closely analyze comparative performance
across subtests, which reveals information about cognitive strengths and weaknesses, possible neuropsychological problems, emotional problems (e.g., depression), and other important clinical material. As with all assessment, data
from intelligence tests is always interpreted in the context of other information
gathered from a broad-based assessment. We discuss broad-based assessment at
a later point.
Users of intelligence tests are required to have training and experience,
usually through graduate education, in administration of standardized psychological tests. Administration of these tests requires strict adherence to test
manual guidelines and clinical judgment and knowledge pertaining to the intricacies of standardized tests. Interpretation of the test data is a complex task
requiring clinical knowledge, judgment, and great care. The ability to establish
and maintain rapport with test-takers is also deemed important. Lastly, clinical skill and professionalism are required to provide feedback to test-takers,
their parents, and the original referral source (school, physician, guardian),
since the results can significantly impact (positively or negatively) the course
of the examinee’s future. The APA Code of Ethics (APA, 2003, 9.10) distinctly
indicates this importance by stating psychologists must be the provider of feedback, regardless of whether employees or other individuals administered the
test batteries.
Personality Assessment
Definition of Personality
Various theorists have defined personality in many ways, over the many years
that the discipline of psychology has evolved. Most definitions and theorists
have agreed that personality refers to stable, enduring characteristics that
uniquely define individuals’ ways of being or of viewing life situations, the
world, and others in it (see Chaplin, 1985, for various definitions). Furthermore, personality may be defined using the terminology of individuals’ temperament and traits.
Temperament refers to a person’s disposition and is often assumed to be
largely biologically predetermined. Much research on temperament has been
conducted on infants and children (Kamphaus & Frick, 1996). Equating temperament with personality may be appropriate according to some psychological
theories, especially those rooted in the psychodynamic traditions or medical
models; other theories might suggest that persons are born with a particular
temperament, and stable characteristics develop in addition to this biologically
predetermined disposition to result in personality.
Traits refer to individuals’ relatively stable ways of thinking or behaving,
or their disposition that may develop over time. The term trait implies that the
environment and one’s interaction with it or others may formatively develop
Introduction to Assessment 153
one’s personality. Traits differ from persons’ behaviors—traits refer to how people are; behaviors describe what people do. If you had to describe your best
friend in three sentences, what would you say? Perhaps, you might say that
your friend is “fun or funny,” “loyal,” “kind and compassionate,” “trustworthy,” “sociable,” “outgoing,” or other similar descriptors. Most people define
others in global terms, describing the most characteristic style of the individuals. They attach these global terms based on behaviors they have observed.
Your friend may be described as “funny” because she tells jokes and elicits
laughter. Some people are described as having “different personalities” depending on the social context (e.g., social versus business). Descriptors, such as
those of your friend, are typically representative of the combination of temperament and traits, or his or her “personality.”
How did you arrive at the description of your friend? If you are like most
people, you have observed your friend in various situations or in interactions
with you. You observed her behavior and the emotions she expressed. You also
noticed her consistent ways of viewing herself and relating to others and her
environment, and made inferences based on these observations. In essence,
you have conducted a personality assessment, because formal assessment relies
on similar processes!
Possible goals of formal personality assessment are diagnosis and understanding of persons’ ways of relating to others and the environment for the purpose of description, prediction, and treatment in clinical or counseling (career
or vocational) settings, employment settings, or forensic settings, among others.
In your assessment of your friend, you have diagnosed (classified your friend)
and attempted to understand him or her. (Don’t worry; if you have chosen to
pursue a career in clinical psychology, you will often be accused of or asked if
you are analyzing your friends anyway!) Substantial training in psychometrics,
test theory, test development, diversity variables (ethnicity, race, culture, gender, age, language, disabilities), and supervised experience are required for use
of most psychological tests, including personality tests (S. M. Turner, DeMers,
Fox, & Reed, 2001).
Objective and Projective Tests
Formal personality assessments use objective or projective measurement techniques rather than casual observation. Objective measurement techniques are
developed based on empirical test development strategies, have established
psychometric properties (reliability, validity; see later discussion), and tend to
be atheoretical (Kamphaus & Frick, 1996). Interpretation of data collected
from objective measurements is done by comparison of individual scores to a
clinical sample of persons with the same background (e.g., age, education
level) or diagnosis of interest. Examples of objective measurement techniques
used in personality assessment include the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality
Inventory-2 (MMPI-2; Duckworth & Anderson, 1995), the Millon Clinical
Multiaxial Inventory-III (MCMI-III; Millon, 1994), and the Sixteen Personality
Factor (16PF) Questionnaire (Conn & Rieke, 1994).
Projective assessment techniques and clinicians’ interpretations of the
data collected from them are grounded in clinicians’ or test developers’ choice
of personality theory (Freudian theory, Jungian theory, Adlerian theory, or
154 Basic Techniques for Clinicians—Assessment
others). Projective tests are more ambiguous from the viewpoint of the testtaker. In other words, objective tests usually consist of direct questions requiring direct responses, usually in the form of choices provided; projective
measures rely on stimuli that could elicit unlimited response possibilities from
clients, without providing them with response choices. Examples of commonly used projective tests include the Rorschach Inkblots (Exner, 1993a,
1993b), the Thematic Apperception Test (Murray, 1943), sentence completion
tests (Lah, 2001), and human figure drawings tests for children (Bardos &
Powell, 2001).
Both objective and projective tests are prone to error in administration if
test manuals are not explicit, or if administrators do not follow the directions
carefully. The interpretation of results from most projective tests is also subject
to variations resulting from clinicians’ biases since they make more assumptions in their interpretations than in those of objective tests about patients’ dynamics and behaviors across situations, persons, and time, and the etiology of
such patterns.
Behavioral Assessment
Behavioral assessment aims to identify the frequency, context, and most importantly, the function of a person’s behavior. The focus of behavioral assessment
is on individual, specific behaviors and comparison of the person’s behavior
across situations and in different environments (home, school, work, social situations). Behavioral assessment developed from the principles of behavioral
therapy, and therefore, emphasizes the importance of behavioral chains, or the
relationships between stimuli and responses, and behaviors and consequences.
In the truest sense, behavioral assessments focus only on operationally defined,
overt, observable behavior that can be objectively measured. Behavior has been
more broadly defined over time with the merging of the cognitive and behavioral theoretical orientations and principles. Behaviors sometimes may refer to
cognitive processes such as coping, which has overt and covert components. Behaviorists may accept this leniency in the definition with the caveat that covert
processes may be considered internal behaviors (O’Brien, Linehan, Dowd,
Kohlenberg, & Nezu, 1999). For the purpose of this discussion, however, behavioral assessment will be reviewed in its truest form.
In general, psychologists might adopt a behavioral assessment paradigm as
a means for evaluating clients and conceptualizing their problems (Haynes &
O’Brien, 2000; A. M. Nezu et al., 1997). As a paradigm, clinicians who base all
assessments on this model do so because it is usually largely consistent with
their theoretical orientation to understanding human behavior, and their approach to assessment and treatment of patients. Chapter 7 in this book is based
in cognitive and behavioral assessment principles.
Behavioral Assessment Questions
What types of question do you think are best suited to a behavioral assessment? Consider the following clinical applications. How frequently does Susan
binge-eat? Under what conditions is Stacy likely to scream and curse at her
Introduction to Assessment 155
partner—what are the antecedents or provoking stimuli to this behavior? What
maintaining variables reinforce Michael’s thumb sucking? What potentially
useful intervention strategies could Raphael’s teacher implement to increase
his attention in the classroom and decrease his noncompliant behavior? Why
does Lola become withdrawn and anxious in some social situations, and yet she
is sociable and conversant in other situations?
Because behavioral assessment may be somewhat of a specialty or a subtype of clinical assessment in general, it is unlikely that referral sources outside
the mental health field will specifically request a “behavioral assessment.” Instead, individuals will phrase their referral question in such a way that clinicians will select behavioral assessment techniques as the means to best evaluate
the behaviors in question. In the most optimal situation, behavioral assessment
will be conducted in the client’s natural setting in which the behaviors are most
likely to naturally occur. However, time, cost, and appropriateness might limit
this option. If so, alternative methods are used to evaluate the behavior under
simulated or somewhat artificial conditions. Or data might be collected by
laypersons involved with the individual, following instruction and training by
the clinician in charge of the evaluation. Lastly, clients may be instructed to
self-monitor their behaviors, although this method is less reliable in most cases.
Ideographic Focus of Behavioral Assessment
Ideographic information is essentially the opposite of nomothetic information;
an ideographic approach to diagnosis and assessment focuses on individual behaviors (overt or covert) and patterns of these behaviors, rather than on group
norms. If an individual reports extended feelings of sadness, depressed mood,
hopelessness, helplessness, and other depressive symptoms, knowing only that
this person’s symptoms are similar to others with the same classification, in a
general sense, will not provide the detailed information necessary to fully understand this individual or effect change. The ideographic assessor must determine the severity and frequency of the specific symptoms, consistent with a
nomothetic approach to assessment. In addition, much more information will
be sought. What developmental factors, recent stressors, or relevant stimuli
contribute to the onset of these symptoms; what thoughts, feelings, behaviors,
or situations maintain the individual’s depressed mood state (A. M. Nezu &
Nezu, 1989; A. M. Nezu et al., 1997)? Ideally, professionals in clinical psychology will assess individuals in a manner that includes nomothetic information
for understanding of normative and nonnormative behavior and symptoms, and
gather ideographic information to maximize individual understanding and the
potential for designing effective interventions.
Selection of Behavioral Assessment Techniques
Because behavioral assessment is largely, if not entirely, consistent with the scientific method, the principles discussed in the section on the scientific approach to assessment describe the approach psychologists take to behavioral
assessment. Clinicians adhering to the principles of behavioral assessment emphasize rater/instrument-reliability (versus subject/target behavior reliability)
and validity as criteria for choosing evaluation tools and methods. Observation
techniques, simulated or analog experiences (e.g., role-plays), self-monitoring,
156 Basic Techniques for Clinicians—Assessment
and ratings by others are all techniques that are frequently used in behavioral
assessment; these techniques are discussed in detail in this subsection.
You may be wondering how this differs from observations made during
interviews or for mental status examinations, and if you are, this is a good
question. The most obvious differences in observations and evaluations made
by behavioral assessors lie in the reliance on operational definitions not only of
the behavior being observed, but also of the increments of time (or frequency)
in which the behavior(s) is (are) being measured, and the settings in which the
behavior occurs (generalization of behaviors). If a clinician was observing and
assessing the social skills of a client, in a true behavioral assessment, it would
most likely not be sufficient to simply state that eye contact was or was not
made if that was a target behavior. Rather, “eye contact” would be operationally defined (Does a glance count? How long does the contact have to be
maintained?), and the period of time in which it was or was not made would be
delineated. A behavioral psychologist might consider how often a person makes
eye contact during a 5-minute conversation, either by counting the times the
client looks at the other person, and then looks away (frequency count in a 5-
minute interval), or by assessing occurrence versus nonoccurrence in specified
increments of time (e.g., 1-minute intervals), in which the specific number of
times eye contact is made within each minute interval is less important. Also,
the behavioral assessor will be interested in knowing if this behavior changes
across settings, people, or situations. This level of specificity provides more precise data from which specific recommendations for change or maintenance can
be made, and thus, differentiates casual observation from behavioral observation as part of a behavioral assessment. Furthermore, the stimuli and consequences would also likely be documented, with the goal of understanding the
function of the behavior within the context of the environment and others. To
collect such specific data, assessors are considered to be a clinical tool and,
therefore, require sufficient training to ensure that ratings are reliable, accurate, and valid.
The Biopsychosocial Systems Model of Understanding
Human Behavior
The biopsychosocial systems model, in concept, if not by name, has been
widely adopted by cognitive and behavioral psychologists (Belar & Deardorff,
1995; Koerner & Linehan, 1997; McDaniel, 1995; A. M. Nezu & Nezu, 1989;
A. M. Nezu et al., 1997; Persons & Tompkins, 1997) and others (e.g., Caspar,
1997) as the schema for understanding individuals’ presentation of problems,
symptoms, and attributes. This model is presented as a logical way for clinicians
to organize their approach to data collection and treatment formulation (described in Chapter 8). The biopsychosocial systems model (Schwartz, 1982) assumes that individuals are complex organisms, and the interplay of their
biology, cognitions, affect, behaviors, social and physical environments, largely
determine their daily functioning and general well-being. Spirituality and cul-
ture, broadly defined, are other important domains, which may permeate each
of the target areas described. According to the biopsychosocial model and behavioral theory, problems may result from multiple causal factors (Haynes,
1992; Kazdin & Kagan, 1994) across these target domains, and therefore, assessments must be broad-based. Clinicians should explore individual functioning within each target area, including strengths and weaknesses, so that on
completion of the assessment, a comprehensive picture of the person can be
drawn to contextually understand the information originally sought.
Most variables within each of the biopsychosocial target areas are assumed to be dynamic and are expected to vary across persons and within persons across time, situations, and settings (Haynes, 1998). Clinicians should
assume that people change over time, as do their problems, and similar problems in different individuals often are the result of different causal variables. A
multimethod, multimodal, multiinformant, time-series assessment is described
in Chapter 7 to address these issues.
The foundation for the biopsychosocial systems model as it is applied here
stems from several theoretical and scientific traditions. George Engel (1977)
originated the biopsychosocial model in the field of medicine. Advances in science and medicine have contributed to knowledge about organisms and biological bases of behavior, and he expanded the medical model to consider other
factors pertaining to human behavior. Psychologists working in medical settings
readily adopted this model (McDaniel, 1995); health psychologists—and later
clinical psychologists—recognized the value of assuming a holistic approach to
mental and physical health care.
Theoretically, the model makes sense to cognitive-behavioral clinical
psychologists, perhaps due to the tenets of social learning theory (Bandura,
1977). Social learning theory explains that investigating reciprocal personenvironment (social, physical) relationships is critical to understanding
human thinking and behavior (Bandura, 1977) as opposed to studying persons in isolation. Evaluating the interactions of biological, social, and psychological variables provides critical information necessary for selection and
change of target behaviors or problems. Psychologists have advocated for a
multimodal approach to assessment of individuals’ problems for many years
(Haynes, 1998; Haynes & O’Brien, 2000; Kanfer & Schefft, 1988; A. A.
Lazarus, 1989; Salovey & Turk, 1991). However, the popularity of the biopsychosocial systems model has increased over the past 20 to 30 years as research
has provided more substantial evidence that the mind and body are interactive and intertwined entities, rather than separate systems (see Hergenhahn,
1992, for a review of historical perspectives), and the roles of spirituality and
religion in psychology have become increasingly investigated.
Target Domains in the Biopsychosocial Systems Model
Assessment of each target area requires more than a simple checklist of items
for each individual. In fact, the pertinent information will vary for each individual. Topographically, however, the examples that follow provide operational
definitions for each target domain. Data within each topic comprises historical
(developmental or recent past history) and current information about the
Introduction to Assessment 157
individual client, and historical and current information about relevant family
members or significant others, and society, if relevant. Given the enormous
amount of information potentially captured by each target area, developing clinicians are reminded to consider each target area across personal, social, and
occupational/vocational situations, various physical settings, and public and
private domains. Information should be obtained about adaptive, maladaptive,
and neutral characteristics or behaviors of each individual.
Biology
Although some health professionals might suggest that mental health problems
are the result of chemical imbalances or biological predispositions, biology in this
model refers to concrete, objective, measurable physical, biological, or physiological characteristics or data. Data collected in this target area about the patient/client include age, sex, physical health, nutrition, heart rate, medical data
(results of blood tests, diabetes, hypertension, fevers), and somatic complaints
(upset stomach, muscle tension, fatigue). Historical information might include
an adult’s report of orthopedic problems in childhood, significant illnesses or
surgeries, or familial history of diabetes or cancer. Clinicians should always inquire about menstruation (onset, regularity/problems, and menopause) of adolescent girls and women, since fluctuations in hormones and changes in mood
are often related. Reports of medications routinely taken provide important biological information, since chemical agents can alter other aspects of persons’
biochemistry, mood, behaviors, and so on. Illicit drugs and alcohol are often
classified as biological variables for similar reasons. Use of illicit drugs and alcohol as a means of coping may also be categorized as behaviors, depending on the
context of the report.
Biological factors and biological assessment of neurotransmitters and
brain physiology, brain tissue, genetics, brain metabolism, cerebral blood
flow, and brain imaging are topic areas that are important to the understanding of human behavior. Scientists in this field have learned much about mental disorders (e.g., dementia, schizophrenia) from studying brain anatomy
and neurobiology, but their work largely remains in the research domain.
Since molecular biological studies do not, yet, directly impact or translate
into clinical assessments (Sweeney, Dick, & Srinivasagam, 1998), the procedures and processes used are not described here. Interested readers are referred to psychiatric journals, such as Archives of General Psychiatry and Journal
of Cerebral Blood Flow and Metabolism, to sample studies produced from this research area.
Affect
Affect refers to a “broad class of mental processes, including feeling, emotions,
moods, and temperament” (Chaplin, 1985, p. 14). Some psychologists define
mood as a global or general feeling state, and affect as a temporal feeling state,
analogous to the weather-related terms climate and temperature. Others view
mood as a subjective report of one’s feeling state (temporal), and affect as the
objective, observable mood state (also temporal) or display of emotions. Sometimes an individual’s affect seems unremarkable; the person seems neither
happy nor sad. Think about many people you know and the characteristics of
158 Basic Techniques for Clinicians—Assessment
their moods, or think about your own affective responses to romantic movies,
comedy shows, or responses to being with someone close to you.
Clinicians need to assess mood and affect for several reasons. Mood and
affect may provide clinicians with necessary information about clients’ primary
diagnoses (e.g., major depressive disorder, schizoaffective disorder), periodic
changes in emotional states secondary to other related problems (e.g., medical
disorders, such as Parkinson’s disease or Lou Gehrig’s disease), co-occurring
problems (mood and medical disorders) or social appropriateness and responsiveness to others. Gaining historical information from clients or significant
others about affect becomes particularly important in understanding the severity or significance of current affective information. Cognitive psychologists and
cognitive-behavioral psychologists pay particular attention to clients’ display of
emotions and self-report of feelings, as they are viewed as cues to identify
changes (or needed changes) in individuals’ thoughts and actions.
Can you think of a time when you found someone close to you crying or
nervous? This affective presentation cued you that something was on your
friend’s mind; perhaps, you asked, “What’s wrong?” Your friend was likely to
share some troubling experience or nervous thoughts about an anticipated
event. Thus, emotions and affect provide us with useful information regularly;
evaluating mood, emotions, feelings, and affect provides rich data for clinicians
as well.
Behavior
In psychology today, behavior is often broadly defined as encompassing all
human activity, whether overt or covert, objective or subjective. Behavior, in its
broadest sense, includes all human experiences and is the focus of clinical psychology. This broad definition, however, is not particularly helpful in structuring data collection for assessment.
Behaviorists (John B. Watson, E. C. Tolman, C. L. Hull, B. F. Skinner) defined behavior as including only objective, observable, overt activity by organisms. In this original sense of the term, sequences of activity or movement, and
patterns of movement characterized behavior. This definition is much more
limiting. Contemporary clinical psychologists who identify themselves as
cognitive-behaviorists, or even as behaviorists, have expanded the term behavior to somewhat of a midpoint between the original definition and the broadest
one. Behavior to these groups of psychologists usually refers to overt and covert
behaviors. Many behaviorists and cognitive-behaviorists will classify physiological events, and thoughts, judgment, or problem solving as covert or internal
behaviors (Cone, 1995; Hayes & Follette, 1993; Linehan as cited in O’Brien
et al., 1999).
For the purpose of clinical assessment, a relatively narrow definition of
behavior is most useful, since cognitions will be assessed as a separate category. (For some variables, the categories may seem arbitrarily separated, but
the distinction is often less important than the acquisition of all the necessary
information.) Behaviors, therefore, are individuals’ objective, observable actions that may or may not be purposeful or intentional. An example of behavior is the posture you are holding while reading this book; both the posture and
the book reading are behaviors. Other examples are nail biting, eating, gazing
Introduction to Assessment 159
off into the distance, smoking, or punching someone. Some behaviors will be
observed by clinicians during the course of an assessment; others will be reported by clients or significant others. Generally speaking, a clinician assumes
a client is properly describing her behavior when she reports that she swims
for exercise; the clinician does not need to view this behavior. (The reliability
of the data regarding frequency may be questionable, but it is likely that the
client and clinician have a mutual understanding of what “swimming” behavior is and is not.) Historical reports of behaviors and reports by others are valued, as described earlier, so that clients’ current behaviors can be understood
in the context of their overall lives (e.g., increase or decrease of frequency, intensity, desire).
Clinicians might inquire about behaviors relating to reported emotions:
What does the client do when he feels angry? Does he throw things? Hit people?
Drink alcohol? Go for a run in the park to release his emotions? Call a friend?
Engage in a different, less anger-provoking activity? Thus, coping behaviors are
important targets of assessment. Other targeted behaviors include health behaviors (e.g., eating habits, exercise, sleeping), unhealthy behaviors (e.g., smoking),
communication behaviors (e.g., verbal and nonverbal activities), interpersonal
behaviors (e.g., sexual activity, social activities), recreational behaviors (e.g.,
movie watching), occupational behaviors (e.g., organizational habits), study behaviors (e.g., daily reviewing of materials).
Cognition
When you have recognized that a friend has made a bad decision, do you ask,
“What were you thinking?” Or maybe you don’t vocalize this question, but
perhaps it runs through your mind! To understand behaviors, problems, and
adaptive functioning, many clinical psychologists rely on the answer to this
question to understand patients’ behaviors and problems. Although some psychologists do not ask direct questions about specific thoughts, cognition is the
core unit of information interpreted by psychologists holding many different
theoretical orientations (see Eels, 1997 for a review).
Cognition, broadly defined, addresses all aspects of information processing: attention, perception, memory, knowledge representations (schemas, imagery), learning (intelligence; achievement; aptitude), cognitive development,
creativity, language, problem solving, decision making, reasoning, and judgment (Sternberg, 1999). Most assessments include a mental status exam, which is
a cursory evaluation (described in more detail later) that allows clinicians to
examine clients’ information-processing abilities to determine if each aspect of
cognitive functioning seems to be intact (within “normal” range). Depending
on which facets of cognition are not intact, clinicians may have to rely on other
sources of information for treatment planning and evaluation, or conduct a
more in-depth assessment that focuses on the troubled area.
In global clinical assessments, clinicians might attempt to answer some of
the following questions: Is the client attentive to questions, responses, and
nonverbal or verbal social cues in session? Does the client exercise good judgment when faced with social or high-risk situations? How effective are the
client’s problem-solving skills when faced with novel or stressful situations?
Does the client engage in rational and systematic approaches to decision mak160 Basic Techniques for Clinicians—Assessment
ing, or does she make careless or impulsive decisions? What images does the
person associate with his traumatic experience, and when do these images
enter his consciousness (e.g., flashbacks during the day, nightmares)? How accurate or insightful do the person’s observations and appraisals of self and others seem to be?
Psychologists sometimes use the narrowly defined terms cognition and
thought interchangeably. Most clinical psychologists assess clients’ thoughts, but
the interpretations made about these thoughts vary across theoretical perspectives. Cognitive psychologists and cognitive-behavioral psychologists thoroughly examine persons’ automatic thoughts and core beliefs (schemas) about
themselves, others, and the world (A. T. Beck et al., 2004; Persons & Tompkins,
1997). Negative automatic thoughts and dysfunctional core beliefs are thought
to be central, and causally related to interpersonal and intrapersonal problems,
according to cognitive theory (J. Beck, 1995). Assessment of thoughts that occurred before, during, and after problematic situations are elicited.
Some assessment questions dictate a thorough, concentrated evaluation of
specific areas of cognitive functioning. A client may be referred for an assessment of impaired memory. The clinician will need to identify if the client’s
memory problems are due to extreme emotional distress (depression), environmental distractions, or if processing information (making new memories,
retrieving memories) is the problem; treatment recommendations will be predicated on the findings. Perception, defined by cognitive neuroscience, refers to
an individual’s reception of incoming sensory information. A clinician, therefore, may seek to answer questions about a child’s school performance, and the
role an auditory processing problem might play in this difficulty. In these situations, the other target domains become contextual rather than explanatory.
Spiritual beliefs, religious beliefs, and philosophies of life are often categorized as cognitions. Spirituality and religiosity have been defined in various
ways throughout the theological, psychological, and medical literatures. Spirituality is concerned with “the transcendent, addressing ultimate questions about
life’s meaning, with the assumption that there is more to life than what we see
or fully understand. Spirituality can call us beyond self to concern and compassion for others”(John E. Fetzer Institute, 1999, p. 2). Fitchett, Burton, and
Sivan (1997) offers a similar definition, but suggests that spirituality can refer
to activities, in addition to beliefs. Spirituality is sometimes encompassed
within religiosity (John E. Fetzer Institute) and vice versa (Reed, 1987).
Religiosity has been defined as having “specific behavioral, social, doctrinal, and denominational characteristics because it involves a system of worship and doctrine that is shared within a group,” (John E. Fetzer Institute,
1999, p. 2). Fitchett et al. (1997) further suggests that religiosity refers to the
adherence to such behaviors and beliefs. Religion fosters spirituality, but people may also engage in religious behaviors without considering themselves
spiritual, according to the description provided. Some professionals use these
terms interchangeably (Reed, 1987; Fitchett et al., 1997), and others maintain
the distinctions in research and clinical work. The Fetzer Institute working
group has identified several domains of religiousness/spirituality that have
stronger theoretical and empirical connection to health and mental health
outcomes: daily spiritual experiences, meaning, values, beliefs, forgiveness,
Introduction to Assessment 161
private religious practices, religious/spiritual coping, religious support, religious/spiritual history, commitment, organizational religiousness, and religious preference. Each of these domains continues to be investigated, refined,
and objectified into assessment measures to aid research and future clinical
work (John E. Fetzer Institute, 1999). Mindfulness has also become increasingly important in psychologists’ and mental health professionals’ work (J. R.
Martin, 1997; Roth, 1997).
Although spirituality and religiosity had historically been less of a focus
for social, cognitive, and behavioral psychologists (John E. Fetzer Institute,
1999), the past 15 years have seen a change in this orientation among psychologists as a whole (Hafen, Karren, Frandsen, & Smith, 1996; Csikszentmihalyi,
1999; D. W. Sue, Bingham, Porche-Burke, & Vasquez, 1999). The difficulty that
these constructs present is that they are not quantifiable or objectively measurable, other than by the behaviors that may result from these beliefs (which obviously then shifts spirituality or religion to behavior instead of cognition).
How can we quantify who is more spiritual or religious? Is someone who
thinks about greater beings and higher powers more often than another person
necessarily more spiritual or religious? Even if an equation could be derived to
compare people on this construct, would there be any utility in doing so? Religiosity is more easily quantifiable, according to some (organizational religiosity,
public religiosity, private religiosity; George, 1999; Idler, 1987, 1999; Levin,
1999), because it represents the practice of religion (behaviors). However, measurement of spirituality and religiosity is still in its infancy.
Despite the difficulty in measuring and assessing spirituality, mindfulness,
and religiosity for groups of individuals and for comparison of individuals, individual qualitative assessment should be an integral part of every evaluation,
since it is an integral part, or not, of everyone’s life. Once an individual endorses the importance of spirituality or religion in his or her life, assessment of
the impact or incorporation of religion or spirituality across target domains is
most useful.
Biology may be positively affected (low blood pressure) by spiritual practices of meditation or yoga (Patel, 1993). Affect may be regulated or controlled
differently for some than others, as a function of spiritual beliefs. An example
may be the expression of emotions in response to the death of a loved one: Individuals who believe in an afterlife may have an easier time accepting a loss,
than those who do not, and therefore, a difference in affect may be noted. Religion and spirituality may affect individual beliefs about psychological or physical illness, and health and care-seeking behaviors. Jehovah’s Witnesses will not
accept a blood transfusion because of their belief that four passages in the Bible
instruct Witnesses not to consume blood; these passages are interpreted differently by other religious groups. In Chapter 3, we followed the case example of
Doris whose religious fatalism had a notable impact on her health-related behavior. Spirituality and religion may be the focus of individual’s social activities
and support networks, as observed in the case of Doris. Recall how such beliefs
or a person’s philosophy of life influences cultural identity. Physical environment may also be determined partially as a result of a person’s spiritual beliefs
or religious adherence. For example, does your client live in a communal set162 Basic Techniques for Clinicians—Assessment
ting, such as a kibbutz or Eruv, or a monastery? Has your client taken a vow of
poverty, or does he or she rely on community for living arrangements?
Spirituality and religion are important topic areas to address with all
clients, regardless of the assessment goal or referral question. It is hard to imagine how these variables would not impact clinicians’ and clients’ concern, if the
topics were important to them. Should spirituality and religious beliefs remain
categorized as a construct within cognition (Belar & Deardorff, 1995)? Should
we address spiritual practices and religious behaviors as separate constructs
from cognitions? Or, does it make the most sense to consider these issues
within the context of a person’s social domain? We think the answers to these
questions are “yes!” Classification is less important here, than broad-based assessment. As psychologists establish the empirical relevance of spirituality to
clients’ psychological and physical well-being, perhaps the biopsychosocial systems model will be renamed the “biopsychosocialspiritual systems model.”
Social Environment
Individuals operate within the context of their environments, and among other
people. Bandura’s social learning theory (1977) asserts that individuals influence their environments, and environments influence people in a reciprocal
fashion. Peer pressure and adolescent smoking demonstrate this relationship. If
social circles dictate, “smoking is cool,” adolescents may be more inclined to engage in this habit to “fit in.” However, if the captain of the football team is
revered by peers and decides that drinking and driving is irresponsible, he may
positively influence the social climate of his classmates. Thus, understanding
the social environment within which clients function on a daily basis is critical
to understanding what individual variables may necessitate change (e.g., assertiveness skills), and what aspects of the social environment or which environments are related to clients’ problems (e.g., the recovering alcoholic whose
friends spend most of their free time in bars). Social environments can include
more distal variables such as society’s values and customs (laws, policies, standards) and cultural factors, or personal contexts, such as nuclear and extended
family, friends and acquaintances, religious or community groups, employment
coworkers, superiors and subordinates.
Strengths and weaknesses are equally important to evaluate in clients’ social environments: How has the client’s family responded to her interracial
marriage plans? Will the client’s employer permit him to work at home after
his surgery, or will he have to take extended leave of absence without pay until
he reaches full recovery? Also, past social factors may provide useful information about why a client is experiencing difficulty, despite functioning satisfactorily in the past: Perhaps the child’s parents recently divorced, or his best
friend moved away. An individual with mental retardation in a group home
setting may be fearful of a new caregiver. However, a senior adult might experience improvements in mood as a result of moving to an assisted living environment where she now has competent help and a new network of social
activities.
Cultural factors may be categorized with social environment (Belar &
Deardorff, 1995), although a case could also be made to view cultural factors as
Introduction to Assessment 163
a target domain unto itself. Culture is defined as “(a) the totality of the customs, arts, science, and religious and political behavior taken as an integrated
whole that distinguishes one society from another; (b) A society or group of
persons whose customs, arts, and so on, set them apart from another group; (c)
The intellectual and artistic aspects of life as opposed to the purely material or
technical” aspects of life (Chaplin, 1985, p. 113).
Much like spirituality and religion, culture permeates individuals’ cognitions, behaviors, and social interactions, view of “appropriate” affect, living
arrangements and sense of personal identity. Culture is different from the constructs of religion and spirituality, however, in that everyone has multiple cultural affiliations. Culture can refer to the norms and values that individuals
identify with, based on their heritage (e.g., Latino culture), religion (Jewish
culture), sexual orientation (gay, lesbian, or transsexual culture), mainstream
society, or other factors that establish the identity of a people. Culture can be
evaluated within a country (Western civilization), a geographic region (“down
South”), family, or other cohort. Occupational environments, schools, and even
programs within schools, have their own culture. Culture can be assessed at the
individual level, molar level of society, molecular level of the person, or varying overlapping levels of each (Brofenbremmer, 1994).
Too often, beginning clinical psychology graduate students, when asked,
will respond that their client has “no cultural variables to consider.” How does
this translate? The student perceives that “the client’s culture is the same as
mine,” or “the client’s culture is that of the majority in the local society; the
client is a 35-year-old, middle-class, Caucasian male.” Beginning clinicians are
cautioned not to assume likeness or differences. Assessing an individual’s culture at various levels is critical to completion of a comprehensive, broad-based
assessment. It is also an ethical obligation (APA, 2003, 9.02b, 9.02c, 9.06).
What information can be gleaned from even the basic description provided? If
not answers, certainly many questions arise: What are the expectations of 35-
year-old men in the client’s family, religious group, or social class? Are young
men expected to work 5 days a week, marry, and raise a family? Earn a certain
living? How have the expectations set by cultural norms affected his view of
himself, others, and the world? How have cultural norms affected his behaviors? Which of these cultural affiliations and its norms are most salient to the
problem of interest? All these questions, and many others, are important to understanding systemic influences on your client’s cognitions, behaviors, affect,
and physical and social environments. Thus, clinicians are charged with the
mission of understanding the cultural norms of the society in which the client
lives, and the social, occupational, and familial environments within which he
or she functions.
Cultural norms are defined as “a standard or set of standards in a given culture derived from the behavior of the generality of the individual members of
that culture; an ordinarily expectable behavioral manifestation or pattern,
against which an individual’s behavior is judged” (Chaplin, 1985, p. 113).
Given this definition, clinicians could have several judgments to make: How
has the cultural values of this client affected (positively, negatively, or neutrally) his or her cognitions, behaviors, affect, and social or physical environments? Is the client’s behavior normal within his or her own cultural norms,
164 Basic Techniques for Clinicians—Assessment
and how does the client’s behavior compare with the cultural norms dictated by
mainstream society? Is the client caught between two cultures, and experiencing difficulty with the hybrid values? Perhaps the client’s functioning is not
maladaptive or pathological from the viewpoint of his or her own culture, but
in the mainstream culture, the person’s behavior is unacceptable.
The DSM-IV-TR (American Psychiatric Association, 2000) has devised a
special task force to look specifically at the impact of cultural variables on
psychopathology. Readers are encouraged to review the DSM-IV-TR for further
discussion of the current issues.
Physical Environment
Clinicians most often conduct assessments in inpatient or outpatient settings,
and less often in clients’ home or work environments. In such instances, we
seldom know much about clients’ living arrangements, living conditions, or
neighborhood, unless we ask. Likewise, gathering information about a client’s
work environment, treating hospital or physician’s office environment, or
school setting may provide critical data necessary to understand a client’s problems or to devise treatment plans to resolve them. Without this information,
even the seemingly best advice may be contraindicated.
In treating a 38-year-old woman for an obsessive-compulsive disorder
(OCD) that led her to check and recheck her locks on her windows, skylights,
and doors, and her electric outlets constantly, the empirically supported treatment for OCD (Foa & Kozak, 1997; Kozak & Foa, 1997) requires the OCD client
to be exposed to the stressor or stimuli (unlocked windows), while inhibiting
the typical response (checking and locking them). The mechanism of action is
that the client’s anxiety peaks and then reduces as she increases her tolerance
to the situation and recognizes that the anticipated negative outcome will not
result. However, this woman was a recovered drug addict who had worked very
hard to earn her rent for her row house in a section of the city that was known
to have a high crime rate and rough inhabitants. Leaving her windows unlocked could pose an actual danger to her child and herself.
Understanding the physical environment surrounding this client’s residence aided in understanding a potential contributing factor to her development and maintenance of extreme fear of losing her tangible possessions. Also,
gaining a historical perspective of this client’s physical environment shed light
on important aspects of her presenting problem. She had a 6-year history of
heroin drug use and had never kept any possessions because she had sold
everything she owned for drugs, including her body (prostitution). Now that
she was clean and sober, had joined a welfare-to-work program, and was pursuing her undergraduate degree, she had too much invested to have her possessions taken from her. In addition to brainstorming ways in which she might
change her living arrangements, exposure and response prevention exercises
were first directed at “safer” targets, such as leaving her empty car unlocked
with the windows cracked, plugging a lamp into an outlet in the wall and leaving it plugged in while she left the room, and learning other techniques to reduce the frequency of her checking behaviors.
A newly married Vietnamese couple came into therapy because their
sex life seemed to come to a halt after returning from their honeymoon.
Introduction to Assessment 165
Apparently, the couple had no sexual difficulties prior to marriage, and therefore, the husband was particularly disturbed by the sudden change. He made
many attributions about himself and their marriage, before a thorough assessment uncovered one of the predominant problematic factors; once married,
the couple moved into the wife’s family’s house. Prior to marriage, sex occurred most often at the husband’s apartment. A thorough assessment revealed that the couple’s bedroom was next door to the bedroom of the wife’s
parents. This was particularly problematic for the wife, because she was
afraid her parents would hear their sexual activity at night. Identifying the
physical environment in which the problem occurred helped to identify the
wife’s cognitions that were negatively impacting the couple’s sexual behavior.
The wife had difficulty accepting that her parents now “knew” she was having
sex with her husband, and she irrationally feared that their views of her
would negatively change. Additional examples in which the physical environment may contribute to, contextualize, maintain, or provide change for
identified problems are many.
Summary
Understanding people, their problems, and their way of functioning requires
clinicians to conduct a multifaceted assessment. The biopsychosocial systems
model, based in social learning theory, acceptance of the mind-body connection, and evaluation of people and systems at various levels, provides a framework for this investigation. Clinicians are encouraged to assess individual
variables (biology, affect, cognition, behavior, culture, spirituality/religion/philosophy of life), social variables (family and significant others, acquaintances,
work-affiliated persons, community groups, culture, spirituality/religion
adopted by significant others, etc.), and physical environment variables (living,
work, and social environments). Historical, current, and potential future conditions should be explored to maximize the utility of the information gained.
166 Basic Techniques for Clinicians—Assessment
167



Chapter 6 prepared you to think about the types of assessment clinical psychologists conduct and the biopsychosocial systems approach to assessment. A goal-oriented approach to decision making begins the process of
assessment preparation. This chapter focuses on structuring the assessor’s critical thinking to be the best consumer of available information. Using the scientific method to approach assessment gears the clinician toward hypothesis
testing, taking an operational approach to targeted domains, and using a multimodal, multimethod, time-series assessment, as appropriate. The use and integration of the psychological assessment tools (clinical interviews, psychological
testing, observation, report of significant others, report of other professionals,
and self-report measures) are discussed.
Learning Objectives
At the end of this chapter, the reader should be able to:
• Explain the scientific method.
• Describe how the scientific method applies to the clinical practice of assessment.
• Define at least three heuristics and biases and explain how they impact the
assessment process.
• Discuss the importance and use of multimodal, multimethod, time-series
assessments.
168 Basic Techniques for Clinicians—Assessment
• Describe the importance of validity and reliability of assessment tools for
clinical planning.
• Explain the pros and cons, and differences, among at least 5 assessment
tools for gathering data.
In the previous chapters, you learned about the historical routes of
cognitive-behavioral therapies, the emphasis on empirically supported approaches to therapy, and the value of research and its contributions to clinical
psychology. For the most part, these discussions focused on groups of people,
according to classification systems and categorization. Focusing on individual
clients poses particular challenges because of the uniqueness and variability in
people’s biology, affect, cognition, behaviors, social systems, and physical environments. How, then, do cognitive-behavioral clinical psychologists gather
useful information about all these different factors? How do we know if this
information is accurate, reliable, and valid? How does this approach differ
from data collection techniques used by other noncognitive-behavioral psychologists? This chapter provides the answers to these and similar questions.
The Scientific Method
Cognitive-behavioral psychologists adopt a scientific approach to assessment
and treatment. The scientific method dictates that inquiry begins with a research
(clinical) question that leads to a hypothesis, or educated guess, regarding the
answer to the question. The hypothesis is operationally defined in clear, objective, measurable constructs or terms. Data is gathered to test the hypothesis,
and then it is analyzed to evaluate if the hypothesis is supported or not supported. Cognitive-behavioral psychologists would argue that the assessment
process, and psychology as a whole, for that matter, operates according to these
scientific principles.
Most clinical hypotheses are works-in-progress and are revised frequently
to reflect acquisition of new data or changes in the client’s circumstances, behaviors, or other information. Thus, according to a cognitive-behavioral assessment
paradigm, hypotheses and assessments are dynamic. Likewise, psychologists’ approaches to assessments must be flexible to accommodate new research, technology, and knowledge about adaptive and maladaptive human behavior.
Biases in Assessment
Hypotheses need to be flexible and dynamic, but so do the clinicians who propose them. Clinicians must be aware of their own tendencies and biases to conduct searches that only lead to support for their initial hunches. By this, we
mean that it is critical for clinicians to seek information that could potentially
disconfirm their hypotheses. Once a clinician is informed that her client, J. R., is
often “impatient,” according to his wife’s report (or his own), the clinician may
be primed to recognize all his behaviors as confirming evidence of his impatience: fidgeting in the waiting room, shifting in his chair, frequent watch checking. Without further inquiry, the clinician may make inaccurate judgments

based on these behaviors and believe that her initial assumption about this person holds true. Clinicians’ must always ask themselves, what else could explain
these behaviors, or what else might these behaviors signify? Proper assessment
of alternative hypotheses is required to ensure the accuracy of the clinician’s hypotheses. In the case of J. R., what else could account for his behaviors—possibly an attention disorder, anxiety, or physical discomfort from arthritis? Maybe
this client is attending the therapy session on his lunch hour and is afraid he will
be late in returning to work. Is it possible that he really needs to find the men’s
room, but lacks assertiveness skills to interrupt the therapy session? “Sometimes
a cigar is just a cigar,” but clinicians need to thoroughly examine their data to be
sure that this is the case.
Although you might like to think that you would have considered many
of the possible explanations for J. R.’s behavior, early research suggests that
most people would not. Herbert Simon argued that most people use heuristics
(mental shortcuts) in decision making, and do not tend to consider all available
explanations or solutions to a problem. Most people will stop searching when
they find a solution that is “good enough,” or generally satisfying; most people
will not seek out the best solution available.
Amos Tversky and Daniel Kahnemann (1974), followed Simon’s work,
and furthered research in this area. Surprisingly, they found that people generally had greater tendencies to use shortcuts in decision making, than tendencies
toward rational and systematic decision making based on complete information
and comprehensive strategies. Don’t we all always look for the easiest route to
get somewhere, or the most efficient means to get something done? Of course
we do. These heuristics often lead to errors in judgment. Based on knowledge
gained from experimental cognitive psychology research, A. M. Nezu and Nezu
(1989) point out that most clinicians are also likely to make these judgmental
errors in their clinical work.
We would like to think that you strive to be better than most people, and
therefore, learning about common heuristics and biases that influence clinical
decision making will alert you to choose assessment strategies that minimize
biases and maximize collection, use, and interpretation of truthful, verifiable
clinical information. Furthermore, adopting a problem-solving approach to
clinical decision making (A. M. Nezu & Nezu, 1989; A. M. Nezu et al., 1997),
described later, will provide you with a framework to maintain cognizance of
this process. The problem-solving model for clinical decision making discusses
the assessment and treatment paradigm (theoretical orientation), biases, and
heuristics as part of the clinician’s worldview (A. M. Nezu et al., 1997), or the
way clinicians understand and conceptualize patients’ problems and human behavior, in general.
Common Heuristics
You take many mental shortcuts every day. How many times have you
attempted to finish people’s sentences for them? Perhaps, you skimmed
this morning’s newspaper, and thought you got the gist of the article, only
to find out you overlooked the punch line. These shortcuts do not have grave
consequences in your day-to-day activities, but the following heuristics might
have a greater impact on your clients, and your clinical decision making about
them.
170 Basic Techniques for Clinicians—Assessment
The representative heuristic, anchoring heuristic, and availability heuristic
are three shortcuts identified by Tversky and Kahnemann (1974) that people
use to assess probabilities and predict outcomes to simple judgments. Often,
these heuristics work when we use past experiences and patterns to make judgments about current events and situations, but there are also many opportunities for these shortcuts to be inaccurate. These judgments may be inaccurate
when people only rely on their own experiences or stories they have learned,
and disregard or do not consider the prevalence of situations or events as they
occur in the general population. We tend to do this when it fits our needs, even
though we may not realize it. A 38-year-old man who is told repeatedly to quit
smoking may retort by exclaiming that his 90-year-old grandmother has
smoked two packs of cigarettes a day for the past 60 years. Why should he believe his health is at risk by this behavior?
The representative heuristic suggests that people attempt to assess probabilities based on the degree of likeness between the current object or stimuli
and a previously developed concept or established stimuli. Essentially, decisions are made based on how much “A” resembles “B.” If asked to guess the
profession of an older woman who wears conservative clothes, her hair in a
bun, and square reading glasses hung on a metal chain, you are more likely to
classify her as a librarian than as a volleyball coach. How often have you seen a
muscular, thin, and fit person and assumed he or she must exercise a lot or be
athletic? Others make the judgment that “women who are very thin must not
eat.” We can all think of people who fit these descriptions accurately, and many
people who do not if we push ourselves to consider fitting examples, and ones
to the contrary. You might be thinking, “How is this different from stereotyping?” If you are, then you are thinking along the right track. Stereotypes are
built on heuristics; fitting someone into that stereotype, then might be an example of the representative bias.
The representative heuristic is related to the concept of schemas, which
should be familiar to you based on your undergraduate course in cognition,
and our discussions in this book. Applied here, people have an associated
framework or mental set (schema) within which to consider incoming information. Thinking about a visit to a psychologist’s office should activate the schema
that represents this notion: an academic office, or perhaps, a clinical outpatient
setting. In assessment, errors in thinking occur when a schema is accessed to
the exclusion of other schemas. A clinician may inappropriately only think of
anorexia as a diagnosis when assessing an underweight adolescent female, and
therefore, does not conduct a thorough evaluation of other target areas of the
patient’s life. Or a clinician may assume that a 75-year-old female patient who
is obstinate with interpersonal difficulties is experiencing cognitive decline or
dementia, when in fact, the patient may have a history of behavior consistent
with borderline personality disorder (Nutkowitz, unpublished manuscript).
One way to correct this error in judgment is to remember the importance of always going outside and beyond what you “intuitively know” or what you think
is occurring, and look for disconfirming evidence or alternative hypotheses.
The anchoring heuristic (Tversky & Kahnemann, 1974) is a shortcut
method of estimation or prediction, involving situations in which final decisions are based more on initial impressions than on subsequent information.
A Scientific Approach to Assessment and Methods of Gathering Data 171
Yes, your mother was right. You had better make a good first impression, because research shows that these impressions are lasting. Although therapists
would like to think their clinical decisions are solely based on facts gained from
their skilled inquisition or observations, we are all at risk for biasing our judgments with first impressions unless we guard against these tendencies.
Consider the following scenario in which a seemingly timid, polite and
proper, well-dressed female client, Wilma, describes her husband in the context of her distress over their marital problems. She tells you that her husband
Roger is insensitive, does not listen to her, and is disrespectful. With further
prompting, Wilma describes several situations in which Roger tells Wilma her
work-related problems are her fault, walks out of the room in the midst of conversations, and embarrasses her in public by apologizing for comments she
makes. Given that Wilma seems quite accommodating and pleasant, how do
you feel about Roger and his treatment of Wilma? The clinician who is aware of
biases and judgmental errors wants to gather additional information, and consider alternative hypotheses so Roger is invited to attend the next session.
When Roger accompanies Wilma, you suddenly learn new information.
This “timid, polite and proper” woman hollers and curses at Roger constantly,
seemingly without provocation. He reports that she is critical and insulting to
him, and does not allow any flaw to go unnoticed. What you now learn is that
Roger’s tendency to walk out of a room, or quiet her in public places are his
coping strategies to deal with her maltreatment. Now what are you thinking?
The anchoring heuristic might have allowed the clinician to continue to think
of Roger as an insensitive, nasty husband, instead of considering his behaviors
as coping strategies. Wilma’s therapy would have taken a very different path if
the new information was not obtained or considered in the formulation or
analysis of the couple’s relationship.
To minimize the potential for the anchoring heuristic to cause judgmental
errors in assessment and therapy, therapists must systematically consider all
data gathered over the course of time, not just in the initial intake. Thus, the
scientific approach to clinical assessment requires time-series or ongoing assessment (Haynes, 1998). Gaining information from multiple sources also helps
contain the tendency to jump to conclusions. Other stimuli that might be red
flags for new clinicians include first impressions of clients with diverse backgrounds or differences from the clinician. As stated, most people make initial
judgments about everyone they encounter; consider how these heuristics may
bias your evaluation of persons with various ethnic, gender, age, sexual orientation, or other cultural features that are different from your own. Or even
more likely, consider how the representative or anchoring heuristics might bias
your evaluation of persons you assume are similar to you!
The availability heuristic, another judgmental error identified by Tversky
and Kahnemann (1974), describes people’s tendency to use readily recalled
information, examples, or instances as the basis for estimating the frequency
or probability of an event. The salience and recentness of events tend to affect
availability estimates and the likelihood of making a judgmental error of this
type.
A classic example of the availability heuristic is the “medical school syndrome.” One day in class, students learn about a rare medical phenomenon that
172 Basic Techniques for Clinicians—Assessment
presents with a multitude of symptoms. Alone, these symptoms are common,
but in combination they are potentially fatal. Later that evening, a student experiences a symptom similar to what was discussed in class earlier that day. He
then becomes 100% certain that he has the disease under study because the
first explanation that comes to mind is what was discussed in class. Learning
about illnesses puts this information in the forefront of students’ minds. Psychology students are also prone to this syndrome. During your psychopathology class, be sure to count how many behaviors you have displayed that are
consistent with various diagnoses. Chances are, for most of the criteria, you
can think about information that is inconsistent with your current line of
thinking, and you will be disregarding information that does not fit the criteria
you are examining.
The availability heuristic may influence clinicians’ thinking in various
stages of assessment and treatment. Suppose a new psychology student, Mary,
has three sessions to test and diagnose a woman who claims she is having trouble concentrating due to racing thoughts. In the first meeting with her, the
client spends the first 15 minutes crying about the recent loss of her pet and the
student has trouble comforting her. Since Mary was not expecting this interaction to be filled with intense emotions, it will likely leave a lasting impression
on her, even if the rest of the two-hour session is particularly uneventful.
Mary’s day became very busy, and she forgot to write her progress note. When
she remembers to do so on the next day, she emphasizes how emotional this
client was throughout the session. This inaccuracy in recall would likely be due to
the availability heuristic. The saliency of Mary’s own discomfort in this experience led her to make an error in her judgment and recall.
Other Biases
A. M. Nezu and Nezu (1989) discuss several other judgmental errors that can
occur in clinical work if proper measures are not taken to prevent them. Such
errors can result from biased search strategies, overconfidence, and causal attributions. None of these terms are likely to be unfamiliar to you but discussion of
the application of these concepts to clinical decision making is critical for new
and even senior clinicians.
Each assessment you conduct and every therapy session you provide will
require you to evaluate many aspects of your client, the session, and your
work. You need to determine the status of your client’s improvement in chief
complaints and responsiveness to treatment in each session. Biased search
strategies lead clinicians to falsely confirm their hypotheses about their clients’
diagnoses, case formulations, progress, receptiveness to treatment, or other
hypotheses as a result of only gathering or searching for information or only
using search strategies, instruments, or tools, that are consistent with one’s
way of thinking, and excluding or disregarding search tools or information that
could potentially disconfirm hypotheses. Selective attention, or only paying attention to cues or information consistent with one’s way of thinking, may be
considered a part of biased search strategy errors.
Consider, for a moment, the last courtroom drama you saw. The attorneys inevitably have a position to defend, and the questions asked of the witnesses they bring forward are directive and closed-ended; “Mrs. Xavier, isn’t it
true that you placed your brother in a psychiatric institute so that you could
A Scientific Approach to Assessment and Methods of Gathering Data 173
take all of his money?” Now, this example may be a bit extreme in clinical psychology, but not by far. Closed-ended and leading questions do not allow disconfirming evidence to surface easily. “Mr. Marcos, you look a lot better than
the last time I saw you. The relaxation techniques must be working, aren’t
they?” By asking this question, the clinician may not come to know that Mr.
Marcos just returned from a week’s vacation in Puerto Rico, where he had no
work or family responsibilities, and slept more hours than usual—without
practicing his techniques at all. However, is he likely to admit this when he is
receiving such praise? Possibly, but possibly not! Biased search strategies can
be avoided by conducting broad-based assessments, covering areas that seem
particularly relevant, and others that may not initially seem important from
the clinician’s point of view. Seeking alternative explanations for targets of interest is also critical.
Errors in clinical decision making about any aspect of assessment, case
conceptualization, treatment, or discharge can also result from clinicians’ overconfidence. Even the most seasoned clinician should adhere to the systematic
and scientific techniques proposed in this chapter, because senior clinicians just
like newly trained clinicians are liable to make errors in clinical work if they are
not careful. Specifically, A. M. Nezu and Nezu (1989) suggest that being overconfident about one’s knowledge can lead to sloppiness or errors in clinical reasoning. Clinicians who think their expertise is superior may engage in biased
search strategies (looking for reinforcements or supporting evidence that they
are great clinicians or researchers), or engage in other judgmental errors, such
as overlooking the need for peer consultation due to inaccurately perceiving
their ability to work with certain complex or difficult patients. An overconfident clinician may be subject to the representative heuristic by misattributing
his competence; “I treated the last patient with anger management problems
successfully so I think this patient will be similarly easy.”
Everyone is susceptible to engaging in errors in reasoning, or biases in
thinking for many reasons. An overarching bias that all clinicians maintain is
that of their own theoretical orientation. The belief systems adopted by clinicians are based on some empirical research, theories, and assumptions (our biases are showing), that are not based entirely in verifiable truth. Belief systems,
or “worldviews” (A. M. Nezu & Nezu, 1989; A. M. Nezu et al., 1997), lead clinicians to make causal attributions about patients’ behaviors according to their
theoretical perspective, which may neglect other important contributing factors. A cognitive psychologist may only examine cognitions to explain why a
client is depressed. If the clinician neglects to send the client for a medical examination to rule out biological factors, and this client’s problem stems from a
thyroid condition, he may be wrongly treated.
As you have been reading this section on heuristics and biases, some of
the examples and scenarios may seem obvious or extreme. In daily practice,
when clinicians do not have the luxury of metacognition (thinking about the
way they think), such errors in judgment may occur more frequently than any
of us would like to believe. Perhaps this itself is a self-protecting bias. The next
section expands on the methods, strategies, and scientific techniques provided
to minimize use of faulty heuristics and biases, and an overall assessment paradigm that will improve the accuracy of our clinical evaluations, judgments,
and decisions.
174 Basic Techniques for Clinicians—Assessment
A Closer Look at a Scientific Approach to Assessment
A scientific approach to assessment, largely based in the behavioral assessment
paradigm (Haynes, 1998), emphasizes, “Empirically based, multimethod, multimodal, and multiinformant measurement of lower-level, precisely specified,
observable behavior and contemporaneous causal variables. The paradigm emphasizes the application of well-validated minimally inferential assessment instruments, applied in a time-series format” (p. 2). That is one quote you would
do well to memorize (once you understand the terminology, of course). The
remainder of this section explains what Haynes, and other colleagues who
contributed to the development of this paradigm (see Haynes, 1998, for additional references), meant by this statement, and why we advocate for following this model.
Following the biopsychosocial systems model, clinicians should use multiple methods (multimethod) to assess clients’ strengths and weaknesses, problems,
and supports. Examples of methods that might be used include interviews, observations, computerized assessments, physiological measurements, self-report
inventories, and other techniques. The key is that one method alone may not
capture the full picture of what you are trying to assess. Someone who does not
appear anxious may still have an accelerated heart rate that is detected by physiological measurement, when led to think about perceived threatening situations.
Thus, relying on observation alone would not provide sufficient information
about the client’s reduction of anxiety during treatment.
A multimodal assessment requires assessment of motor behaviors; verbal
behaviors, expressions, or statements; biological factors; affective responses;
and cognitive processes. In Chapter 6, the biopsychosocial systems model was
discussed. You should already be prepared to understand this concept.
In an ideal world, clients come to therapy fully knowing and understanding their problems and how these problems manifest themselves (behaviors, affect, etc.), and therefore, their report about their problems provides accurate
and complete information. In the real world, many clients lack insight about
their problems and have altered perceptions of their own contributions to the
problems, or how others are affected. Information from the perspectives of the
client’s peers, parents, significant others, bosses, and teachers, contributes
enormously to a truly comprehensive picture of the client’s life problems,
strengths and weaknesses, and interpersonal relationships. Data from multiple
informants (multiinformant assessment) provides a context for information
gained directly from clients. Of course, clients’ informed consent is always required prior to contacting these additional persons.
Lower-level variables require clinicians to go beyond diagnoses or theoretical constructs that are general in many ways, to exactly specify the target of assessment or change. If someone is “depressed,” your overall goal might be to
decrease depression. However, just knowing someone is depressed does not
help you to know what you are evaluating. Does the person have thoughts that
she will “never meet a partner?” Is she able to go to work or enjoy activities she
previously enjoyed? Does she have poor problem-solving skills? Identifying
lower-level variables requires clinicians to become more specific in their assessment so that they can understand the client’s problems. The goal is to find out
what the manifestations of depression are for this particular person, and what
A Scientific Approach to Assessment and Methods of Gathering Data 175
the contributing and maintaining variables of these depressed features might
be. Identifying the lower levels of the problem also will allow treatment planning to be more focused.
In accomplishing the identification of lower-level variables, cognitive, behavioral, and cognitive-behavioral clinicians focus on behaviors (overt or
covert) rather than on traits. That is, they focus on what people do, versus who
they are. To help you recognize the difference, take a moment to recall your
three-sentence description of your best friend. Most people offer descriptions
such as, “My friend is fun to be around. S/he is loyal. My best friend is dependable.” These statements represent characteristics or traits of your friend; they are
general statements. Now think about how you came to these conclusions.
Chances are, you arrived at these characteristics by engaging in three steps: you
observed or experienced your friend’s behaviors; summarized and labeled these
behaviors; and inferred that what he or she does because of these traits. Relying
on inferences in clinical assessment and therapy can result in problems we have
already discussed—heuristics and judgmental biases. Therefore, clinicians are
encouraged to assess measurable constructs or variables whenever possible.
When traits and characteristics are discovered through personality testing, clinicians would do well to explore these findings further to arrive at the lowerlevel variables related to these features. Identifying what people do, broadly
defined, rather than who they are, will enable determination of specific assessment and treatment goals.
Precisely specified variables are concrete and, according to behaviorists, objective. Although objectivity is not always possible in clinical assessment (e.g.,
pain cannot be objectively measured), minimizing ambiguity about persons’
problems and behaviors usually is possible. Operational definitions aid in minimizing ambiguity as information is shared among professionals and between
professionals and clients. Operational definitions are discussed in detail later in
this chapter.
True behavioral assessment focuses only on what a human objectively
sees; thus, the paradigm calls for observable behaviors. Cognitive and cognitivebehavioral therapists have often expanded their assessment to cognitions as
well. Our earlier discussion of the biopsychosocial systems model elaborated
this point. Our bias is that assessment and treatment should not be focused on
hypothesized intrapsychic factors, but on operational, precisely specified overt
or covert (cognitions) behaviors. Recall our behavioral example of someone
doing something; a person (you) sitting in a chair (behavior), reading this book
(behavior). Now add to that observation, the cognitive behavior of learning
(concentrating, recalling, abstracting) and evaluating (this textbook is really interesting!). These are all potentially observable behaviors, if you know the
proper methods of observation.
Furthermore, focusing on contemporaneous events—current events, thoughts,
behaviors, and feelings that are happening in the relative moment—yields more
useful targets in assessment and therapy than historical events. Historical information may provide understanding about the etiology of patients’ problems,
distal contributing factors to the presenting problem, and a context for understanding patterns of behaviors. All this information is deemed important to case
conceptualization; history, however, cannot be changed, but how one thinks and
feels about it can be. Historical information may be pertinent or even critical, but
176 Basic Techniques for Clinicians—Assessment
how someone is thinking, feeling, and behaving currently as a result of a historical occurrence or about a historical event should be the foci of attention and the
targets for change.
Because this model of assessment supposes that (a) behaviors, thoughts,
and feelings are ever-changing, (b) contemporaneous variables should be targeted, and (c) assessment is dynamic, clinicians ascribing to this model should
conduct time-series assessments. Basically, what you know about a client today
may not be true next week, and therefore, one assessment does not provide a
lifetime of answers, but rather a peek through a keyhole revealing what is
going on at the moment. The adolescent girl, who “hated” her mom last week,
may have been over it a few days later. You might be misguided to assume that
you should pick up where you left off, without a review of the past week’s session and a request for an update.
Most clinicians begin their sessions asking how the client is currently feeling (more specifically, how depressed are they? How anxious have they been in
the past day/week? etc.). The behavioral assessment paradigm suggests an even
more systematic approach to monitoring patients’ symptoms and behaviors. Information gathered only at one point in time may lead to erroneous practices
and judgments for many reasons. Consider our earlier example of the client who
was distraught over her dog’s death. She is not necessarily always tearful and
weepy, but the clinician will only know this if assessment occurs repeatedly over
time. Repeated measurement ensures that the behaviors (thoughts/cognitions,
feelings, etc.) assessed in the first meeting are consistent and representative of
the person, rather than a rare occurrence. Time-series assessments may be accomplished through self-report diaries between sessions, brief assessments at
the beginning of each assessment session, and so on. Once therapy has begun,
ongoing assessment must continue to monitor changes resulting from the intervention or other factors. Without ongoing assessment, clinicians are unlikely to
know if clients are compliant, if treatment is effective, or if other major concerns arise.
Now you have a better idea of what it means to build an assessment on
“empirically based, multimethod, multimodal, and multiinformant measurement of lower-level, precisely specified, observable behavior and contemporaneous causal variables” (Haynes, 1998, p. 2), with assessment occurring over
time. The next section describes what is meant by, “the application of wellvalidated minimally inferential assessment instruments” (Haynes, 1998, p. 2).
Reliability and validity are critical issues to assessment, and other aspects of
clinical psychology, such as research, test construction, and program evaluation. These core concepts, therefore, warrant in-depth discussion.
Reliability, and Validity
Clinicians who maintain a scientific approach to assessment and treatment
gather data by using tools and techniques that are strategically selected for their
psychometric properties. Specifically, cognitive-behavioral psychologists strive
to obtain information with reliable and valid tools and techniques. This is not to
suggest that noncognitive-behavioral psychologists prefer to use unreliable and
invalid methods; however, the degree of emphasis on developing and using
A Scientific Approach to Assessment and Methods of Gathering Data 177
techniques with known psychometric properties varies across theoretical orientations (see Eels, 1997, for comparisons). Clinicians ideally determine the reliability and validity of psychological instruments and measures prior to using
them to maximize the likelihood that the data they gather are meaningful.
Some instruments require periodic checks to ensure these qualities are maintained over time.
Operational Definitions
An “operational definition” is defined as “(a) the procedures or measures that
are used to define a construct; (b) a definition of a construct in terms of the operations used to produce and measure it” (Johnston & Pennypacker, 1993). Use
of operational definitions minimizes inferences made by clinicians or by others
using information obtained from an assessment. They are important for various
aspects of assessment: understanding the variables being evaluated, understanding the intended use of particular psychological instruments, defining
“target behaviors,” interpreting results or collected information, and communicating results to others.
If you provided a clinical assessment report to another therapist and simply stated that the client, Molly, has “difficulty relating to others, specifically
people who remind her of her mother,” will the other therapist know what you
mean? What does “relating,” mean? Is the client incapable of making friendships, holding conversations, cognitively understanding and interpreting verbal
and nonverbal information? And which characteristics of her mother are important in differentiating between people who are “like her mother” and “unlike her mother?” Operational definitions of the terms difficulty, and relating,
and descriptions of the characteristics about “mother,” would allow you to perform more precise and accurate data collection and provide a more useful report of the information you obtain.
As a guiding rule, an operational definition needs to be specific enough to
allow two skilled or trained people to observe the same behavior or construct
and obtain the same results. “Difficulty,” for Molly, therefore, may be defined
as her “uncontrolled thoughts about others’ perception of her, increased sweating and flushing in interactions involving only her and one other person in direct conversation, and induced stuttering when asked direct personal
questions.” More precision in definitions of “relating,” and “remind her of her
mother” would also be required.
Understanding what a client means when he reports feelings of “sadness”
may also require an operational definition to foster clearer understanding between the clinician and the client. A clinician’s definition of “sadness” may be
different from that of the client. To monitor the increase or decrease of sadness
in a client, an operational definition must be created. The client might operationally define sadness as exhibiting tearfulness or absence of smiles, feeling
“alone,” and “empty.” If the clinician does not satisfactorily understand this
definition, he might ask for an objective definition, “If you are feeling sad,
what would an observer see?” Also, a clinician may ask a client to quantify the
severity or intensity of his sadness by rating his feeling on a scale of 1 (absence
of sadness) through 10 (most intense sadness). Using this subjective rating
scale will allow the clinician to assess whether the client’s sadness improves or
178 Basic Techniques for Clinicians—Assessment
worsens over time, according to his own report. These are just a few ways that
cognitive-behavioral psychologists attempt to increase precision in their own
understanding of clients’ problems using scientific, concrete, objective methods. Operational definitions are critical to ensuring accuracy in assessing and
reporting human behavior; they also are essential to establishing reliability
and validity of assessment tools and data.
Reliability
Reliability is another criterion for selecting useful assessment measures and
techniques. The APA Ethics Code (APA, 2002, 9.02a, 9.02b) states that psychologists use assessments in the manner supporting research deems appropriate,
valid, and reliable for the population being tested. The concept of reliability is
often referred to in discussions of measurement in general, and specifically in
clinical assessment and research. Reliability of tests and instruments refers to
how accurate or free from error a tool is with regard to measurement. A reliable assessment technique or measurement will almost always produce the
same data according to a gold standard. Every time a 5-pound weight is put on
a scale, the scale should read “5 pounds.”
Precision and exactness is necessary to have reliability, but unique to reliability is the idea that data gained from a particular technique or instrument
will be consistent over time or across observations or people. A measurement tool
or instrument can be reliable but not valid. Your bathroom scale can reliably
over- or underestimate your weight, meaning that if your scale tells you that
you weigh 150 pounds, and you measure 150 pounds each time you stand on it
(assuming you have not gained or lost any weight), your scale is said to be reliable. However, your scale could overvalue your weight by 20 pounds, according to your physician’s scale, which was calibrated by standardized weights and
measures. If this were the case, your bathroom scale would be reliable but not
accurate. Note, however, that measures cannot be consistently accurate and not
reliable—give that some thought!
It is important for you to know if a test is reliable. Otherwise, any changes
detected over time will be difficult to interpret. Are changes in scores due to
change in the behavior or trait of the person, or due to the inconsistency of the
measure? Are changes due to measurement error such as instrument calibration? Or are changes due to error in the measurement technique? Clinicians
and researchers need to predict the answer to these questions based on their
measurement selection.
Several common types of reliability are considered in test construction
and selection of assessment measures (Kazdin, 2003). Test-retest reliability describes tests with temporal stability; tests with high test-retest reliability show little interference by influence of everyday life, and reveal consistent scores over
a specified elapsed time frame. We would expect that one’s IQ (intelligence
quotient) or GRE scores would have high test-retest reliability over a onemonth time frame, assuming no formal instruction was provided in the interim. In contrast, we would not expect, nor want an anxiety measure to have
temporal stability. Thus, test-retest reliability, in part, refers to the measure’s
ability to detect differences over time, and also depends on the construct’s stability over time (i.e., humor trait versus anger state). Alternate-form reliability
A Scientific Approach to Assessment and Methods of Gathering Data 179
describes the consistency between two forms of a test measuring the same construct by use of a similar set of items. Standardized tests should possess this
psychometric property since the different versions of the test, administered at
different times across students or within one administration, usually contain
different questions. (Perhaps you remember getting either pink or yellow test
booklets, depending on which row you sat in during one of your undergraduate
class exams.)
Internal consistency represents a similar concept to alternate-form reliability. However, this form of reliability refers to the consistency within one test.
So, if an exam had 100 questions, these 100 items should statistically show
positive relationships among them. Interrater reliability refers to the consistency
between two or more persons scoring a test, interview, or other stimuli, or
recording or classifying observations, where some subjectivity could conceivably interfere with the results. If you and your classmate both interviewed 10
clients today, interrater reliability would tell you how consistent you are in diagnosing clients using the DSM-IV-TR. Interrater reliability is often achieved by
training, practice, and reevaluation of raters’ performance. Interrater reliability
is especially important in behavioral assessment and evaluations of research
treatment protocols, and in establishing clinicians’ ability to use certain semistructured interviews and clinician-rated or report-by-other measures.
Special types of correlation coefficients are used to evaluate reliability statistically, and most psychometrically sound tests will report these reliability coefficients to allow consumers to determine if the test is reliable for their intended
use. Some tests that are used include the Kuder-Richardson test and coefficient
alpha (internal consistency), kappa (interrater reliability), and Pearson productmoment correlations (test-retest reliability, interrater reliability). Further discussion of reliability coefficients is beyond the scope of this chapter; we defer to
your statistics professor for this explanation.
Validity
In the test construction lingo, when psychologists refer to validity, we are addressing whether a test adequately rather than just accurately measures what it is
supposed to measure (based in part by Anastasi’s, 1988 definition). Two general questions need to be answered: Does the instrument adequately measure
or represent the subject matter intended? Will the data gained from the measure really mean anything? More specifically, will the data be useful to learn
what this measure will tell us for the purpose of this particular assessment of
this particular person, in a particular situation (adapted from Paul, 1969). As
described here, validity is referring to the function of the assessment tool or protocol, rather than just the structure. This description would also fit a discussion
of the validity of a therapy intervention, a client’s self-report, or a significant
others’ report. Several types of validities are specific to test construction/assessment measures, but only a few will be discussed here: construct validity, content validity, concurrent validity, divergent or discrimination validity, and
predictive validity. You should become familiar with these validities, as you will
want to evaluate these psychometric properties for each assessment tool you
consider in your work. Your assessment and research courses will cover these
topics in more depth.
180 Basic Techniques for Clinicians—Assessment
Construct and Content Validity
Many psychological tools have names that represent what they measure,
specifically, the underlying concept or construct that is being addressed. The
Beck Depression Inventory-II (A. T. Beck, Steer, & Brown, 1996), is one of the
most popular measures of depression. The content of the questionnaire is consistent with the diagnostic criteria of depression, and experts would agree that
this measure inquires about symptoms most commonly associated with depression. The measure has established construct validity, or is said to represent and
cover information assessing the construct of depression.
It is important for measures to have established construct validity, and for
users of assessment instruments to ensure this of the measures they choose.
Caution is warranted because a measure’s name may suggest it covers a certain
topic area, or addresses a particular underlying psychological phenomenon, but
this may not be an accurate label. Quality of life measures vary greatly in how
“quality of life” is operationally defined. Some measures are geared toward assessment of medical patients, and therefore, focus largely on strength and physical function. Other measures of quality of life include more items relating to
spirituality, social and physical relations, and psychological constructs (Simmons et al., 2006). Researchers and clinicians are still trying to operationally
define “quality-of-life” in a meaningful way that allows measures to be developed to represent this concept. Similar difficulties arise in defining the construct of spirituality, transcendentalism, and other nonobservable psychological
constructs (self-esteem, cognitive dissonance).
Once a construct is established, test developers are challenged to ensure
that measures of the construct are content valid. Do the items in the test or measure accurately reflect the construct or domain of interest? How well does the
measure represent the theoretical or scientific construct that has been advanced? When a construct is defined by a particular measure, it is difficult to
separate construct and content validity. The Burnout Inventory (Maslach &
Jackson, 1981) was developed to measure burnout. This instrument includes
scales of exhaustion, skepticism, and personal self-efficacy; these terms are
precisely what have been offered to define and explain burnout, and essentially
no other measures of burnout exist. Users are left to assume that the items in
the inventory assess “exhaustion,” “skepticism,” and “personal self-efficacy,”
(suggesting content validity) and that these scales represent the greater construct of burnout. Without other measures of comparison, it is difficult to conduct further studies of validity (i.e., convergent validity, to be discussed).
Users of psychological assessment tools need to evaluate tests’ psychometric properties to verify how the authors assure users that the test measures the
topic area it intends to measure, and for what populations (for persons of what
ethnicity, age group, or other personal characteristics), the content is valid.
Construct and content validity are particularly important because without
knowing the validity of the measure chosen to evaluate individual characteristics, how can researchers or clinicians know how to interpret the findings they
achieve? Other forms of validity such as convergent and discriminant validity
aid in this evaluation. These types of validity are also common and important
for selecting and determining the utility of a particular test or measurement for
a specific purpose.
A Scientific Approach to Assessment and Methods of Gathering Data 181
Concurrent Validity, Convergent Validity, and Discriminant Validity
Choosing among the numerous assessment instruments that may be available
for a given construct or topic area is typically based on a variety of factors. If
the psychometric properties are sound, the clinician will then consider the cost
of the instrument, the time it takes to administer or complete it, the time to
score and interpret the results, credentials required to use the test, reading and
writing ability required, appropriateness for intended age group, cultural background, client’s language, and other related reasons. Clinicians and researchers
need to know how the measures they may select compare with other measures
they have available to them. Reported data on a measure’s concurrent validity
provides this information for users.
Concurrent validity refers to how closely the data gleaned from an assessment tool correlates to performance on a different measure at the same point
in time. If childhood anger and childhood aggression are expected to be highly
related in boys with oppositional defiant disorder, it would be expected that
measures of each of these constructs (anger, aggression) will be highly related
when given to a group of boys with these characteristics. As another example,
a test of fine motor skills and a test of speed in copying symbols are likely to be
correlated in senior adults.
Convergent validity is a form of concurrent validity (Kazdin, 2003), and is
related to discriminant validity, which is described later. Convergent validity
refers to the overlap or similarity of two measures’ abilities to assess the same
construct, trait, or behavior. If one measure is compared with another measure
that has predetermined reliability and construct validity, and they are intended
to evaluate the same construct, a high correlation between the measures suggests the comparative measure has convergent validity. If you created a new
depression inventory that was going to be free for public use, took two minutes
to complete, and could be self-administered and scored, potential users would
want to know how your measure correlates with the Beck Depression Inventory-II (A. T. Beck et al., 1996) or the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression
(Hamilton, 1960) since these two measures are well-known to have good psychometric properties and much research to support their use.
When evaluating a measure’s convergent validity, ideally the correlation
between the measure in question and measures of comparison will be strong
enough to suggest that the two measures are evaluating the same construct and
gaining relatively the same information if the measure being evaluated improves on or has some advantage over the existing measure. If the goal is to
identify a secondary measure of a particular construct (depression), then finding a measure that is strongly but not entirely correlated with the second measure is ideal. This suggests that the combination of the two measures provides a
more comprehensive picture of clients’ depression than use of only one of the
measures.
Discriminant validity, in essence, is the opposite of convergent validity. Discriminant validity refers to the ability for the measure in question to reveal different information than another measure that is expected to measure a
theoretically different or unrelated construct. “Stress” is a different construct
than optimism. Stress has been defined as an imbalance between the actual or
perceived demands on someone, and the person’s perceived ability to cope or
182 Basic Techniques for Clinicians—Assessment
respond to such demands (R. Lazarus, 1999). Optimism is defined as “an inclination to put the most favorable construction upon actions and events or to anticipate the best possible outcome” (Merriam-Webster Online Dictionary). These
two constructs are obviously different in theory and presentation. A measure
of depression and a measure of stress may show some relationship when compared in large numbers, but the correlation between these measures is expected to show little or no correlation, since they are measuring separate and
distinct constructs (Kazdin, 2003).
Predictive Validity
Whereas concurrent validity refers to how closely the data gleaned from an assessment tool correlates to performance at the same point in time on a different
measure, predictive validity is established by examining the relationship between
a measure under question and performance on another measure at some point in
the future. To enter graduate school, you most likely had to take the Graduate
Record Examinations (GREs), and the Miller’s Analogy Test (MAT’s). These
tests are intended to predict performance in graduate education. If the results of
these examinations correlate with graduate students’ grade point averages (or
some other measure of academic performance), then these tests would be said
to have predictive validity. Predictive validity is not essential to all tests or
measurements, unless the intended use of the measure is to serve a predictive
function. Some instruments are designed for use as point-in-time assessments
only, and therefore, their ability to predict future behavior or performance on
another measure is not deemed essential.
Methods of Gathering Data
Some assessments are more systematic (scanning the refrigerator and pantry
before going to the supermarket; evaluating budgets in consideration of purchasing large-ticket items), and others are less so (comparison of lines to stand
in at the grocery store). Similarly, assessment techniques in clinical psychology
vary greatly in their purposes and goals, and the methods by which data collection is accomplished. This section discusses methods of data collection, rather
than data instruments directly. Emphasis is placed on structured, formal assessment techniques, rather than on informal methods. Brief explanations of the
following tools are provided: interviews, tests, inventories and checklists, observation, logs and diaries, projective measures, physiological assessment, analog assessment, and instrument-assisted and computer-assisted data collection.
Further reviews of these methods of data collection are likely to be covered in
full assessment courses.
Interviews
The clinician’s most basic tool is an interview. Whether the purpose of a
client-therapist interaction is for assessment only, therapy, forensic evaluation, job counseling, or some other purpose, most interactions do or should
A Scientific Approach to Assessment and Methods of Gathering Data 183
begin with an interview of some sort. In actuality, most first human encounters take the form of an interview in some sense of the term. One person initiates a series of questions of the other person to gain more information
about the other’s background, expectations, goals, and needs. Think about
your last encounter in a retail store. The salesperson probably asked you the
following questions: “Can I be of help to you? Are you looking for anything
in particular? Do you have a specific price range within which you aim to
stay?” The goal of this line of inquiry is to gain information about you. This is
the same goal of clinical interviewing.
Like effective sales techniques, clinical interviewing goes beyond these
basic questions. Clinical interviewing is goal-directed, requires active purposeful questioning, effective listening and requesting of clarification, observation,
and the “nonspecific factors” (Beutler & Clarkin, 1990; Castonguay, Goldfried,
Wiser, Raue, & Hayes, 1996; Lambert, 1986) of good rapport (warmth, empathy, and unconditional positive regard). More details about how to structure an
interview (even unstructured interviews) and incorporate these components
are discussed in Chapter 8.
The most common types of interviews include initial intake interviews
(first meeting overview), exit interviews (closure to a clinical relationship),
mental status interviews, crisis interviews, and diagnostic interviews. The goals
and purposes of these interviews are the same as the overall goals of assessment.
Among these types of interview, there are three major formats: structured,
semistructured, and unstructured.
Interview Formats
Structured Interviews
Structured interviews are usually published or preestablished and standardized
lists of questions with specific directions or flowcharts of questions to ask following certain responses. These interview outlines (similar to scripts or questionnaires) are used for predetermined purposes (diagnosis, symptom, or
behavior description) and allow for comparison of responses across individuals
or therapists. Since the interviews require little clinical judgment or inference,
persons without graduate training in psychology can be trained to use structured interviews under supervision. The Diagnostic Interview for Children and
Adolescents (DICA-R; Reich, Jesph, & Shayk, 1991) and the Structured Clinical
Interview for DSM-IV (SCID-I; First, Spitzer, Gibbon, & Williams, 1997) are two
examples of such interviews.
Semistructured Interviews
Semistructured interviews require more clinical skill and judgment. These interviews, such as the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (Hamilton, 1960), provide a list of questions or content areas that need to be covered. The exact
wordings of the questions or order in which they are asked are determined by
the clinicians. Often, the flow of a semistructured interview seems like a more
natural dialogue between the clinician and client compared with a structured interview, which provides little opportunity for tangential patient self-disclosure
or input into the direction of the interview. Much like structured interviews,
184 Basic Techniques for Clinicians—Assessment
many semistructured interviews are published in manuals and provide scoring
instructions and normative or comparison scores. Semistructured interviews are
commonly used in qualitative research and in clinical assessments.
Unstructured Interviews
Unstructured interviews are clinician driven, and are usually individualized to
the purpose of the assessment. Since they are not manualized and are not accompanied by administration or scoring instructions, unstructured interviews
are rarely, if ever, used in research settings. The quality of data gathered by clinicians using unstructured interviews is entirely dependent on the clinicians’
interviewing skills, clinical judgment, and insight. This type of interview structure is most susceptible to individual biases and requires the greatest amount of
training and skill for maximum results.
Uses of Interviews
Initial Intake Assessment
Initial intake interviews are designed to gain an overview of a patient’s problems,
strengths, and resources, and reasons for seeking assessment, treatment, or hospital admission. In some ways, it can be viewed as a needs assessment of the patient,
and an opportunity for the clinician’s observation, diagnosis, and short-term
and/or long-term clinical pathway goal planning. Intake interviews often include
a combination of mental status interviews and diagnostic interviews.
Mental Status Assessment
Mental status interviews focus on a client’s current psychological functioning.
The goal of a mental status interview is to gain an overview of client mental
health, and identify normal versus abnormal or unusual thinking, thought processing, behaviors, or other characteristics. This type of interview has specific
components and is mostly factual and data-based. Clinicians make little to no
interpretations of data collected in this type of interview, with the exception of
some estimation of judgment, insight, and intellectual functioning, which may
be largely based on clinical impression.
The mental status interview goes beyond the exchange of questions and
answers, and incorporates many behavioral observations. Behavioral observations include evaluation of the client’s hygiene based on presentation, gait,
speech (normal, pressured, slowed, slurred), eye contact, posture, behavioral
manifestations of mood disorder (e.g., anxiety as represented by excessive fidgetiness or handwringing), and other observations. Traditional questioning is
used to inquire about a client’s orientation to persons (Who are you? Who
brought you here? Who am I? Who is the President of the United States?),
places (Where are you now? What city and state do you live in? Where were
you born?), and time (What time of day is it? What day of the week is it? What
year are we in? What holiday is coming up next?), thoughts, mood, affect, behaviors, short-term memory (e.g., remember this list of three objects, and I will
ask you about them again later) and cognitive functioning (attention, concentration), medical status (e.g., use of medications), illicit and legal substance use,
estimate of intellectual functioning, suicidal and homicidal history or current
A Scientific Approach to Assessment and Methods of Gathering Data 185
thoughts or plans, insight, and judgment. Assessment of delusions and hallucinations is typically included in this evaluation.
As mentioned, most mental status interviews are conducted as part of an
intake or subsequent evaluation. Because this interview is a standard clinical
method of assessment and not typically used for comparative purposes, formalized rating scales are rarely if ever used. Shea (1988) and Morrison (1995),
among many others, provide a more extensive discussion and guidelines for
mental status interviews.
Crisis Interviews
Psychologists who work in acute psychiatric services, emergency rooms, or outpatient mental health clinics are most likely to conduct crisis interviews. However, most clinical psychologists need to conduct crisis interviews periodically,
regardless of their setting of employment. Crisis interviews are directed toward
clients who are in acute distress due to an exacerbation or increase in psychological disturbance, or who have suffered a traumatic or life-threatening incident. Because these situations can arise in any setting (psychiatric, medical,
school, research, etc.), all therapists must be prepared for the responsibility of
determining clients’ imminent risk for harming themselves or someone else, or
inability to care for themselves, given a heightened state of psychological
arousal or psychotic episode.
Crisis interviews are more focused than intake interviews, and diagnostic
interviews. Often, portions of a mental status exam, if not an entire exam, will
be incorporated into this type of interview. Crisis interviews have the specific
purpose of informing therapists’ decisions about patients’ safety, placement
(psychiatric or medical hospital admission), or immediate intervention (crisis
hotline leading to police outreach). Questions are typically focused on gaining
information about crisis situations, chief symptom complaints, symptom
duration and severity, clients’ safety, resources and supports, risks, and overall
client functioning. Rational and systematic clinical decision making, and
knowledge and facility with procedures for individual settings (e.g., emergency
help contacts, involuntary commitment procedures, steps for assisting women
to leave homes of domestic violence) are two of the most important therapist
attributes necessary for management of crisis situations and crisis interviews.
Exit Interviews
Exit interviews are conducted at the end of an inpatient or outpatient treatment, medical inpatient visit, or occupational tenure. These interviews provide
therapists or another designated professional or paraprofessional with an opportunity to review assessment or therapy content with clients; provide feedback on progress; help clients engage in future thinking about maintenance of
treatment gains or managing future problems; create plans for future crises, relapses, or booster sessions; and gain clients’ feedback on the usefulness of various aspects of the treatment. When exit interviews are conducted by the
therapist at the end of treatment, these interviews are often called “termination
sessions,” although one could argue that ending treatment marks a new beginning for clients, rather than an ending. A termination interview provides a
forum for clients to appropriately express their feelings and emotions about
ending therapy. Effective termination is explored more fully in Chapter 14.
186 Basic Techniques for Clinicians—Assessment
Test Instruments
Tests used in clinical psychology are similar in structure and function to tests
you have been exposed to throughout your education and training. Standardized psychological tests are tools that assess clients’ functioning in terms of personality, educational or cognitive content areas, adaptive skills, or abilities.
Typically, the word test implies that these tools ask questions or use tasks that
have “right” and “wrong” answers to which clients’ responses are compared.
Usually, tests are accompanied by manuals that provide scoring information,
decision rules, and instruction for administration, and standardized results or
scores on the test based on large groups of individuals with specific characteristics (e.g., age groups, culture, gender, “normal” versus “clinical” population).
The results of standardized tests are usually provided in terms of scores on subscales and overall test performance.
Cognitive Function Tests
Tests that are commonly used in clinical psychology include tests of cognitive
functioning: attention, perception, memory, intellectual abilities (e.g., intelligence or IQ testing, such as the Wechsler Scale of Adult Intelligence-III revision; WAIS-III; Wechsler, 1997; Psychological Corporation, 1997), speed in
information processing or dexterity in fine motor skills, and other areas of
neuropsychological or cognitive abilities. Consistent with the assessment goal
of prediction, psychologists might administer aptitude tests to determine
clients’ potential abilities. Aptitude tests are defined as “designed to give a
quantitative estimate of a subject’s ability to profit by training” or measure
“future achievement” (Chaplin, 1985, p. 34). Achievement tests are similar to
aptitude tests, except that current, rather than future, abilities are evaluated.
Achievement tests may be subject-specific, or more global in content. The
Wide Range Achievement Test (WRAT; Wilkenson, 1993) is a commonly used
achievement test.
Personality and Symptom Checklists, Inventories, and Scales
If you have ever been surveyed at your local shopping mall, or have completed
a physical history form at your physician’s office, chances are that you have
completed a checklist or inventory. Unlike standardized tests, checklists and inventories generally do not have right or wrong answers, although they should
have psychometric evaluations of reliabilities and validities provided in their
manuals, and typically have comparison scores for various populations. Their
purpose is to assess the presence or absence, or occurrence or nonoccurrence of
particular thoughts, feelings, behaviors, characteristics or traits, over a designated period (e.g., today, past week, past month). The Fear Inventory (Cautela,
Cautela, & Esonis, 1983) is an example of an inventory that offers a list of
items that children commonly fear. An assessor might read this list to a small
child and ask him to endorse items or objects that make him scared: “Are you
afraid of . . . a vacuum cleaner? A barking dog? The dark?” Alternatively, the
child’s parent might respond to the written questions. The Minnesota Multiphasic Inventory-2 (MMPI-2; Duckworth & Anderson, 1995) is a very common
personality inventory used in clinical psychology. Clients are asked to read 567
A Scientific Approach to Assessment and Methods of Gathering Data 187
adjectives and respond whether each adjective does or does not describe them
by responding to a true-false format.
While checklists are almost always in the form of “check all that apply,” or
“check the top three that apply,” and inventories may take the form of questions or statements to be endorsed, scales assess the frequency (how often?) or
quantity (how much?) of occurrence or nonoccurrence of the characteristics in
question, or the degree to which the individual agrees or disagrees with particular statements. Likert-type scales versus Thurstone scales (to be described) are
used to measure the attitudes, frequencies, or quantities according to ranges expressed in words representing incremental increases (always, sometimes,
never; strongly disagree, moderately disagree, disagree, neutral, agree, moderately agree, strongly agree), or numeric values that have anchors specified on
the instrument (on a scale of 1 to 5, 1 = never, 5 = always). A true Likert scale
is an attitude scale focusing on agreement or disagreement with three or five
incremental values (Chaplin, 1985). This commonly used rating scale method
has been adopted by many and adapted to use ranges from 3 to 10 ascending or
descending values; thus, the format is often referred to as a “Likert-type scale”
versus “Likert scale.”
A Thurstone scale is similar to a Likert scale in that clients’ attitudes are
being assessed about standardized questions, situations, or characteristics.
However, rather than assessing degree of agreement or disagreement, clients
select a statement from a range of statements that is most consistent with their
views. The Beck Depression Inventory (BDI-II; A. T. Beck et al., 1996) uses a
Thurstone scale. An example item similar to those on the Beck Depression Inventory is as follows: Please endorse the statement that best describes how you
feel: (a) I do not feel stressed; (b) I feel stressed; (c) I feel stressed all the time
that I can’t control it; (d) I feel so stressed all the time that I can’t stand it. The
method for deriving the pool of statements is beyond the scope of this chapter;
however, as with other clinical instruments, psychometric properties of any
tests, inventories, checklists, and scales should be evaluated prior to selection.
Checklists, inventories, and scales can either be designed for the client to
complete or for someone else to complete about the client. Given that most assessments should take a multimodal, multimethod, multiinformant approach,
rating-by-others instruments provide a time-efficient means of collecting such
data. Child and adolescent assessments especially rely on ratings by others, such
as ratings by parents, teachers, peers, or significant others. The Conners Rating
Scales for assessment of attention deficit disorders exemplify three versions of a
similar scale: self-report, parent or significant other report, and teacher report.
Observation
Observation is an important part of various types of data collection, such as interviews, role-plays, or analog assessments. However, observation is a data collection method in its own right. It is one of the key tools used in behavioral
assessments, and various strategies are used in this method. Observations may
be conducted in a naturalistic setting (the client’s own home, work, school, or social environment), or in a controlled environment or situation (a simulated environment that the psychologist creates in which the behavior of interest is likely
188 Basic Techniques for Clinicians—Assessment
to occur). Cost, time, frequency of the behavior, and public or private nature of
the behavior will dictate which setting is likely to be used.
Psychologists and training laboratories often have two-way mirrors in
their offices designed so the client(s) can be in one office where the situation is
set up to encourage the behavior in question, and the psychologist can discretely observe the behaviors in the adjacent office on the other side of the twoway mirror. This setup is an example of a controlled situation. A couple who is
having marital trouble and difficulty communicating may be told to sit in a
room and discuss their finances for 20 minutes, during which time the psychologist observes behaviors such as use of “I” statements (“I feel,” “I think” versus
“you make me feel” . . .), effective listening, interruptions, summarizing statements, raising of voices, cursing, hostility, validation of feelings, and possibly
other behaviors.
In the absence of two-way mirrors, other controlled situations such as
role-plays may be used. Sometimes also called analog assessments, role-plays are
brief interactions between the patient and therapist (posing as someone else
significant to the contrived situation), between two clients, or a client and
psychological assistant (a confederate), that involves the simulation of a scenario in which the client would likely engage (or not) in the behavior under
review.
A 32-year-old male, Jon, who has social anxiety, may be learning techniques to assert himself. During the course of treatment, he decides he wishes
to ask a woman to go on a date, but he feels nervous about doing so. The therapist may ask the client to imagine having the opportunity to speak with the
woman privately, and engage in the dialogue he might have with his potential
date as the therapist role-plays the woman. The importance of role-plays is that
clients actually engage in the behavior, rather than tell the therapist what they
would do. So, instead of Jon saying, “Well, I would walk up to her and maybe I
would say ‘hi.’ I would then probably ask her how her weekend was,” Jon
would actually stand up, cross the room, and approach the therapist as if he
was in the room with the woman he is speaking about. He would initiate conversation as if it were a real-life situation; “Hi Maria. How are you? How was
your weekend? . . .” This interaction is similar to acting in a play. Role-play is a
valuable technique for ongoing assessment, but is also useful for rehearsal to
acquire new skills. Several standardized role-play tests exist (e.g., C. M. Nezu,
Nezu, & Gill-Weiss, 1992), although the majority of these exercises are developed in the moment by clinicians.
Observation as a strategy minimizes the biases that could be introduced
into self-report measures or report-by-others measures (interviews, checklists,
inventories, scales), such as clients intentionally presenting themselves in a
certain way (e.g., good, bad, innocent, passive) by providing inaccurate information. However, the presence of the observer may introduce a new bias. In
naturalistic or controlled settings, the presence of the observer may impact the
frequency or natural occurrence of the client’s behavior in question. A client
may want to put his best foot forward, and therefore, may demonstrate his
“best” behavior, more than he would if he was not aware that he was being observed. Likewise, another client may become shy or inhibited and reluctant
to engage in certain behaviors if she knows she is being watched. Observers,
A Scientific Approach to Assessment and Methods of Gathering Data 189
therefore, usually situate themselves in inconspicuous places where their presence can eventually be disregarded to some extent. Observations of clients and
their target behaviors take place for a long enough period to acquire a reasonable “sample” of behavior, and allow the client(s) to habituate to (get used to
and tune out) the presence of the observer.
Clinical Example
A psychologist was conducting a behavioral observation of a 9-year-old Hispanic female, Gia, who reportedly had
behavioral problems in the classroom.
On the first visit to the classroom, the
psychologist sat in the back of the room,
so that the other students would not be
constantly watching the “stranger.”
However, the first hour of observation
resulted in little unbiased data because
several of the student’s classmates
turned around frequently to ask questions such as, “Doctor, do you speak
Spanish?” “Doctor, are you here because Gia is crazy?” “Doctor, look at my
cool pencil bag!!” and Gia was initially
seeking the psychologist’s attention.
However, with proper redirection and
nonattendance (“extinction”) of the
children’s behaviors, eventually, they
found other activities to entertain them,
and they lost interest in the stranger!
For the purpose of data collection, observations usually rely on a therapist-created systematic data collection system, and are based on operational definitions
of behaviors to be monitored, called target behaviors. Systematic data collection
systems include measuring the frequency of the occurrence or nonoccurrence
of a particular behavior, descriptions of the behaviors that occurred (perhaps
according to a checklist of adjectives), and record keeping of events of antecedents and consequences to the target behavior. Antecedents are behaviors,
events, or stimuli that are observed to precede the target behavior. Consequences are those behaviors or events that are sequelae to the target behaviors.
Recording observations of antecedents, target behaviors, and consequences allows data collectors to look for patterns in situations that increase, decrease, or maintain the behaviors in question. Skinner (1953) referred to this
type of data interpretation as a functional analysis. Such analyses allow clinicians
to understand, for example, why a mother “loses her control” with her 3-yearold daughter. After making observations either during home visits or discrete office interactions in the waiting room, the clinician realizes that the child begins
yanking on her mother’s sleeve and tapping her relentlessly when the mother is
talking to others or engaging in an activity that does not involve the child. The
mother, in response to this behavior, swats the child from her sleeve and tells
her to “wait a minute.” However, the minute comes and goes, and the child continues this behavior, until finally, the mother turns and yells at the child. Once
she yells, the little girl cries and the mother ultimately picks her up to soothe
her. Based on that brief description, supposing that the child’s nagging behavior
is the target, what do you think are the antecedents and the consequences? Why
does the child continue to engage in this behavior time after time?
190 Basic Techniques for Clinicians—Assessment
Psychologists, clinicians, or laypersons trained by professionals can make
observations and collect data systematically. It is common for clinicians to provide clients or significant others with a data collection system (or record sheets)
and ask them to record their own observations of their behaviors in between
sessions. This introduces the biases mentioned about self-reports, but useful
data may still be obtained. Such observations or rating forms are sometimes referred to as diaries or self-monitoring logs. Data collected by diaries or selfmonitoring logs include food diaries (recordings of dietary intake); individual’s
thoughts, feelings, and behaviors relating to specific problem situations (A. M.
Nezu, Nezu, Friedman, Faddis, & Houts, 1998); record of daily activities; data
logs of daily time spent for relaxation; and mood record forms detailing individual’s maximum anxiety, depression, and pleasantness experienced each day.
Projective Measures
Tests and stimuli such as the well-known Rorschach inkblots, Sentence Completion Tests, and Thematic Apperception Test (see Groth-Marnat, 1990, for a
comprehensive review) are called projective measures because they require examinees to project their unconscious thoughts, feelings, beliefs, wishes, and understanding of the world onto the ambiguous or semistructured stimuli. To
understand the concept of projection, you must consider Sigmund Freud’s theory that persons are born with an id, ego, and superego.
Id, Ego, and Superego
According to Freud, the id represents basic instincts that are uninhibited and
focused on libido, immediate gratification, and excitement; the id is the deepest
level of a person’s unconscious. The ego represents the conscious self, and is the
part of a person’s mind that is aware of others’ needs in addition to one’s own.
The ego is the part of the mind that is responsible for thinking, perception,
memory, and other cognitive processes. It is also responsive to the need for
gratification and may often be conflicted between what the person wants versus what is appropriate in reality. Lastly, the superego is one’s conscience that
leads individuals to distinguish and act according to what is socially right versus
wrong. The superego operates without individuals being aware of it acting; the
superego keeps the ego and id in check!
Projection as a Defense Mechanism
Freud theorized that projection is one of several defense mechanisms a person’s
ego (conscious self) uses to protects itself from trauma.
Projective measures go hand-in-hand with personality assessment and
psychodynamic approaches to assessment and case conceptualization. Projective
measures are also used to aid in diagnosis although results from these tests alone
are not sufficient to make a definitive diagnosis, since this was not their intended use. Projective measures enable clinicians to obtain more data than direct questioning or objective tests and measures for clients who are resistant to
share information or simply for individuals whose defense mechanisms (psychodynamic explanation of persons’ ways of psychologically protecting themselves)
prevent conscious recognition of their own dynamics and characteristics. This
A Scientific Approach to Assessment and Methods of Gathering Data 191
rationale is more consistent with psychodynamic theories than with cognitivebehavioral theories. The advantage of uncovering information from clients’ subconscious, which may be unavailable to clients’ consciousness, is balanced by
the fact that the conclusions drawn from data obtained are based on evaluator’s
interpretations and theoretical assumptions about personality. For instance, a
client is asked to describe a picture that objectively shows two males on a park
bench looking at the same focal point. The client explains that the picture is of
two orphans who are sadly watching a family enjoy a Sunday afternoon at the
park. There is nothing in the picture that objectively indicates that this is fact.
However, the response may reflect background information about the client’s
personal life, occupational experience, or sense of social awareness. The explanation of the picture goes beyond the objective facts. The interpretation of the
response goes beyond the facts about the client. The client’s description of the
picture is thought to project his or her own thoughts, feelings, beliefs, or experiences. The interpretation of the client’s response may also reflect biases and beliefs the assessor holds about the client.
Physiological Measures
Direct assessment of individuals’ bodily responses to internal and external
events is accomplished through physiological assessments. Such assessments
are common in relation to bodily responses to stress and relaxation, pain (e.g.,
headaches), sexual functioning or dysfunction, and sleep. Examples of physiological assessment devices include biofeedback instruments measuring galvanic
skin response (skin temperature changes), blood pressure, heart rate, and respiratory sinus arrhythmia (relating to depth of inhales and exhales). Special
training in the use of physiological assessments is required and can usually be
offered through graduate courses, practicum or supervised learning placements, or on-the-job training for technicians.
Taking a closer look at possible uses of physiological assessment, consider
the last time you had an argument or were unexpectedly confronted by someone who was angry with you, do you recall the physical sensations that accompanied your rise in stress? If you are like most people, your heart rate increased,
perhaps your face flushed and your hands became warm, and you may have engaged in rapid breathing patterns (shorter breaths). These sensations might have
also resulted from an internal cue, such as the moment you remembered that
you had forgotten your coat at the restaurant you left 30 minutes prior, or the
recognition that you had forgotten to bring your wallet when you were ready to
pay for your groceries! Physiological assessments allow professionals to evaluate
such responses in individuals to determine the extent of the impact of internal
and external stressors or relaxation practices on their physiology.
An example of physiological assessment in the evaluation of sexual functioning (normal and deviant response patterns) is provided by discussion of the
penile plethysmograph. This instrument is used to measure penile tumescence
or physiological arousal in males in response to provided stimuli (e.g., audiotapes of potentially arousing scenarios, sexually arousing visual images). The
penile plethysmograph has been used frequently in the assessment and treatment of sexual offenders.
192 Basic Techniques for Clinicians—Assessment
Technology-Assisted Data Collection
With the advancement of technology, test developers have sought to ease the
cost and time associated with psychological test administration and interpretation. Computer-assisted interviews are sometimes used to collect initial client
contact information and even diagnoses-related data. Some clients may prefer
to disclose personal information in this seemingly more private fashion; others
may be less likely to share details of their past or current circumstances without
human contact and gentle prompting or questioning. As an initial screening
tool, this method may allow for information to be gathered in a time- and costefficient manner.
Many self-report inventories are also available in computer program format (e.g., MMPI-2). Clients respond to questions on a computer screen, rather
than in the traditional pencil-and-paper format. Responses to such inventories
are computer-scored, and computer-generated interpretative reports can often
be furnished. The benefits of this format over pencil-and-paper formats are obvious—patients are less likely to miss items, legibility is not an issue, and computer scoring saves time. Furthermore, test administration is sure to be
standardized when administered by computers, and decision rules required by
administration of many tests will surely be followed.
There are certain risks or limitations that should be considered. Clients
unused to computers might be computerphobic (older adults, persons who do
not use computers in their daily work or personal life), and therefore, technical
aspects of the computer may distract them from the task. Persons with visual
impairment or mobility/dexterity problems may have difficulty using computers. Another possible limitation is that test administrators may rely too heavily
on computer-generated reports and overlook supplementary or complementary material gathered from other sources, even though the APA Ethics Code
advises caution on this matter (APA, 2002, 9.06). The initial cost of many of the
administration, scoring, and interpretation programs can be exorbitant, and
many programs can only be loaded onto one computer, limiting the portability
of the tests, or accessibility of tests to group practice professionals. Computerassisted tests are becoming more popular, as the pros seem to outweigh the
cons, and the pencil-and-paper tests remain available as alternatives. The Conners’ Continuous Performance Test is an example of a useful computer-assisted
assessment for Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder.
Psychologists and other mental health professionals often use other technology to assist in data collection. Tape recorders, video recorders, pedometers,
telephones, and personal handheld computing devices (PDAs), can assist in
data collection and ongoing monitoring of target symptoms, thoughts, feelings,
or behaviors. As a homework assignment, couples may be required, to taperecord their efforts to discuss difficult topics using newly learned communication skills. The clients or clinician can review tape recordings in session, or
privately for reevaluation or provision of feedback. Video recorders might be
used during implementation of behavior modification plans or for parent training. Clinicians might instruct clients to leave voice-mail messages about completion of daily homework assignments or mood-scale reporting. Handheld
devices may be the ideal place for patients to record their coping attempts or
food diary since PDAs are usually carried with avid users at all times, allowing
for immediate recording of pertinent information. These suggestions represent
only a small sample of possible data collection enhancement via computer and
other electronic devices.
Summary
The scientific method provides a paradigm to guide clinicians in conducting assessments. A hypothesis-testing approach to answering assessment questions
leads to a broad-based evaluation of individual strengths, weaknesses, and targeted areas that is open to correction and validation, regardless of the type of assessment being conducted. Operational definitions are critical to specify exactly
what is being examined and for what purpose. Clinicians’ own biases and
heuristics are potential confounds to the assessment process, and mindfulness of
one’s viewpoints is deemed critical. Assessment tools must have reliability and
validity, as emphasized in details about these psychometric concepts. Lastly, several data collection methods, including interviews, tests, checklists, scales, observation, physiological measures, and technology-assisted data-gathering
techniques were discussed highlighting the uses for each of these techniques,
and preferably a combination of several.

The Logistics of the Assessment
and a Closer Look at Interviewing
In this chapter, we take a closer look at how to build an assessment protocol,
how to decide what needs to be assessed, and how to integrate clinical assessment into clinical practice. We discuss the use and integration of psychological assessment tools including clinical interviews, psychological testing,
observation, reports of significant others, reports of other professionals, and
self-reports. A problem-solving approach to clinical decision making and assessment, in particular, is emphasized to assist clinicians in the assessment and
treatment process.Learning Objectives

196 Basic Techniques for Clinicians—Assessment
Thus far, we have discussed the goals and various types of psychological
assessment and the biopsychosocial paradigm as a model to guide assessment.
We have also applied scientific principles to data collection and outlined methods and tools to conduct assessments; qualifications for responsible test use;
and ethical principles for assessments. You may still have many questions about
assessment procedures. You might be wondering, (a) How do psychologists decide whether to accept a referral for assessment? (b) How do they choose the
type of assessment to conduct? (c) What role does the clinical interview play
when so many standardized tests are available to gather information, and what
does it really entail? (d) How are assessment tools, such as particular tests, selected for specific assessments, beyond looking at the psychometric properties
(reliability and validity) of the instruments? (e) What do psychologists do with
all the information they gather—how is information communicated?
The goal of this chapter is to answer these questions, which all relate to
decisions that the clinician must learn to make involving the logistics of assessment. The clinician must learn these logistics in terms of strategies as well as
procedures. We begin with a discussion of the problem-solving model of clinical decision making (A. M. Nezu & Nezu, 1989; A. M. Nezu et al., 1997) as a
model for assessment strategy. This model provides a useful framework to
guide the assessment (and treatment) process. It will orient you toward thinking critically about each decision that needs to be made throughout the assessment and therapy process, regardless of theoretical perspective. This chapter is
intended to help you “put it all together,” which is probably one of the biggest
challenges graduate students face in applying didactics to clinical settings!
Strategic Logistics and a Problem-Solving Approach
One of the most fascinating and stimulating aspects of clinical work is that no
two clients are the same, and each person is uniquely complex and challenging.
This reality is also what makes clinical decision making and critical thinking
difficult to teach to new clinicians—no “cookbook” exists to guide clinicians
through decision making for assessment and treatment. A. M. Nezu and Nezu
(1989) developed a problem-solving approach to clinical decision making
based on a social problem-solving model that has been applied for treating a
variety of clinical disorders and for increasing social competence (see D’Zurilla
& Nezu, 1999, for a review).
Social Problem Solving
According to the problem-solving model, social problem solving is the cognitivebehavioral process by which individuals understand problems in living and directing their efforts at finding solutions to them (D’Zurilla & Nezu, 1999; A. M.
Nezu, 1987). According to the clinical decision-making model, the clinician is the
problem solver, faced with the many challenges that accompany each stage of the
therapeutic process. We discuss the therapeutic process according to the following stages: (a) screening and understanding the reason for referral; (b) broad-
The Logistics of the Assessment and a Closer Look at Interviewing 197
based assessment, including in-depth consideration of the chief complaint, (c)
treatment design, and (d) evaluation of treatment effects.
Understanding the social problem-solving model requires familiarity with
the operational definitions provided for problems, solutions, and effective solutions.
After establishing that foundation, we discuss the core components of the social
problem-solving model: problem orientation, problem definition and formulation, generation of alternatives, decision making, solution implementation and
verification (D’Zurilla & Nezu, 1999; A. M. Nezu et al., 1998).
A problem, according to the social problem-solving model, is a discrepancy
between one’s current state of affairs or situation and one’s goal (A. M. Nezu,
1987). In daily life, persons are constantly presented with situations or tasks
(demands) that require responses or action to achieve desired goals. These demands may be placed on oneself, or come from others, or the environment.
Discrepancies occur between “what is” and “what one would like a situation to
be” when obstacles interfere with one’s ability to affect the situation or demand.
Obstacles to goal attainment might include intrapersonal variables (maladaptive thinking, biases, actual or perceived skill deficits), extrapersonal variables
(unrealistic demands of others, competing demands or responsibilities, differing goals between self and others), situation-specific variables (uncertainty,
unpredictability, novelty), inadequate psychosocial or tangible resources, or
other conflicts or challenges. Problems may be isolated events (e.g., dealing
with a client in crisis), a series of similar or related events (e.g., classes that run
past the designated ending time, unreliable hired child-care providers leading
to work absenteeism for parents, anger outbursts during interpersonal disagreements), or a pervasive difficulty that occurs for a short or long duration
(e.g., procrastination, stuttering, poor time management, inability to say “no”).
Situations may result in problems for one person, and yet the same situations
may be manageable by another person. Problems are individualistic, and therefore, definable only by the person(s) who is (are) experiencing them.
Using the preceding definition, the problems clinicians confront in the
therapeutic process are still many. Clinicians begin a first session with minimal
information about a client and must eventually understand why each client is
presenting for testing, treatment, or other clinical services. Just because clients
request services of a mental health professional does not mean that the clinician must agree to work with them; deciding whether one is qualified to provide the requested services for each individual is a critical problem that
requires an important decision. This problem may resurface at various time
points in the therapeutic process. Selecting appropriate approaches to assessment from all the available techniques, tests, and formats represents another
clinical problem. Likewise, the intervention stage presents numerous problems
to be solved: selecting and designing, implementing, and evaluating treatments
appropriate for each client, given the individuality of each person’s circumstances, strengths, resources, deficits, needs, and other factors consistent with
the biopsychosocial assessment conducted.
Solutions are defined as any coping response designed to change a problem
situation, one’s emotional reaction to it, or both (A. M. Nezu, 1987; A. M. Nezu,
Nezu, & Perri, 1989). Solutions are also individualistic (one person’s choice to
create a month-long study schedule to prepare for an upcoming exam versus
198 Basic Techniques for Clinicians—Assessment
another’s plan to cram the night before an exam). The same solution for one
person may be adaptive (spending extensive time alone), whereas it is maladaptive for another, or may be adaptive in one situation, but maladaptive in another
for the same person. Solutions may be effective (assertiveness to prevent disrespect) or ineffective (i.e., aggression in response to disrespect).
The goal of social problem solving is to devise and implement effective solutions. Three specific criteria define effective solutions. Effective solutions, evaluated according to the problem solver’s judgment (a) solve the targeted problem
(meet the desired goal state), (b) maximize the positive consequences, and
(c) minimize the negative consequences. Systematic evaluation of solutions
warrants consideration of individual variables, one’s environment, and the
person-environment relationship (D’Zurilla & Nezu, 1999). Thus, the goal of
each clinical task in the therapeutic process is to achieve the preestablished shortterm or long-term goals by identifying, selecting, and implementing effective
clinical solutions (identify and operationally define the patient’s problems; prescribe and teach relaxation training to an anxious person in need of behavioral
controls for pain resulting from muscle tension; overcome obstacles to treatment,
such as poor attendance or noncompliance with homework assignments).
Components of Social Problem Solving
Effective solutions and optimal outcomes are achieved through adaptive social
problem solving, according to the clinical decision-making model (A. M. Nezu &
Nezu, 1989). Nezu and Nezu assert that using systematic, rational problemsolving skills aids clinicians in minimizing judgmental errors, and maximizing the
likelihood of selecting and implementing optimal treatments for individual clients.
Social problem solving consists of five main interactive, reciprocal component
processes that are further broken down into specific skills and tactics. The component processes are problem orientation, problem definition and formulation, generation of
alternatives, decision making, and solution implementation and verification. The following
explanations are not as detailed as the original model because a comprehensive discussion of the problem-solving model and its applications is beyond the scope of
this chapter. The interested reader is referred to several problem-solving therapy
manuals (D’Zurilla & Nezu, 1999; A. M. Nezu et al., 1998), and the most relevant
clinical decision-making book (A. M. Nezu & Nezu, 1989) for in-depth discussion.
Problem Orientation
Problem orientation is a motivational set or worldview—how a person tends to
think about problems, based on his ideas, beliefs, and assumptions. Does he view
problems as challenges or barriers? Does the problem-solver believe in her ability to solve problems effectively, or does hopelessness or helplessness override
her feelings of self-efficacy? Problem orientation can either facilitate or hinder
effective problem solving, and the use of the other problem-solving skills.
For clinical decision making, worldview incorporates one’s theoretical orientation, or the set of ideas, beliefs, and assumptions about human behavior,
personality, and change, that the clinician uses. Adhering to the biopsychosocial
model as a paradigm for understanding behavior, subscribing to multimodal,
multimethod, multiinformant, time-series approaches to assessment, or adhering to specific ethical guidelines represent components of one’s worldview. Clinicians’ worldview is believed to guide problem-solving efforts relating to
The Logistics of the Assessment and a Closer Look at Interviewing 199
clinical decisions (A. M. Nezu & Nezu, & Lombardo, 2004). The common use of
heuristics (discussed in Chapter 7) and biases that are likely to positively or negatively influence clinicians’ decisions are also encompassed in their worldview.
Problem Definition and Formulation
If you went to your physician’s office today and told him or her that you “don’t
feel well,” how will he attempt to rectify this problem? Will he provide you
with aspirin? How about an ice pack? Will she offer an ointment of some kind?
Will he recommend bed rest or more exercise? Unless you are truly not feeling
well at this moment (in which case your mind immediately gravitated to your
specific symptoms), neither you nor your doctor could predict how you would
be treated. Why? Because not feeling “well” could mean many different things.
Your doctor would not know whether (s)he should concentrate on your eyes or
your ankles! Most likely, your doctor would ask you specific questions about
your current state of well-being, or lack of well-being. The physician needs to
identify the specific problem(s), clarify his or her understanding of the problem,
and establish goals for treatment outcome.
This is the essence of the problem definition and formulation component
of problem solving, and the importance of this step in the process cannot be
sufficiently emphasized. Identifying and defining problems and establishing
goals for each stage of therapy are essential to progress efficiently and effectively toward needed results. The following questions highlight some of the
problems to be defined throughout the therapeutic process: Why is the patient
seeking treatment? What are the components of the person’s problem, such as
cognitive distortions, dysfunctional family patterns, newly acquired physical
disability? What unique client or therapist variables limit the clinician’s ability
to implement a particular empirically based therapeutic intervention? Why
hasn’t a treatment regimen led to the gains expected?
Effective problem definition and formulation relies on several skills and
tasks. Problem solvers (clinicians, in this case) engage in the following practices. They (a) seek all available facts and information about the problem; (b)
describe these facts in clear and unambiguous terms; (c) differentiate relevant
from irrelevant information, and facts from assumptions; (d) identify the specific factors that make the situation a problem for the particular therapist,
client, or both; (e) set realistic and attainable problem-solving goals (D’Zurilla
& Nezu, 1982, 1999; A. M. Nezu & Nezu, 1989; A. M. Nezu et al., 1989, 1998).
Generation of Alternatives
Once a problem is defined and realistic goals are set, problem solvers need to
find ways to reach these goals. To attain goals, effective solutions, as earlier defined, must be identified. This is not an easy or immediate task for many people. If it was, a problem might not have occurred in the first place! The goal of
the generation of alternatives component of problem solving is to use creativity
and broadened thinking to conjure up as many potential solutions as possible;
evaluation of the alternatives comes later.
Brainstorming skills are prescribed to identify effective solutions, according
to the problem-solving model (D’Zurilla & Nezu, 1982, 1999; A. M. Nezu &
Nezu, 1989; A. M. Nezu et al., 1989, 1998). Two rules govern brainstorming
efforts: (1) the quantity principle, and (2) deferment-of-judgment principle. The
200 Basic Techniques for Clinicians—Assessment
quantity principle simply suggests that generating as many ideas as possible will
increase the likelihood that an optimal solution will result—quantity leads to quality. Since people are often used to relying on previously developed skills, ideas, or
techniques, it is sometimes difficult to “think outside the box,” and as a result, a
person’s usual ideas surface and may be quickly rejected. The deferment-ofjudgment principle dictates that ideas are not evaluated during brainstorming,
since “nay-saying,” or “yes-butting” (yes, but, this won’t work because . . .), closes
off the creative process, and stifles efforts to think of novel alternatives or use ordinary solutions in novel ways. Thus, more high-quality ideas are likely to result
if judgment of alternatives is suspended during this process.
Generating alternative solutions to clinical problems becomes necessary
in a variety of circumstances. Consider how the complexity of individual client
variables might affect assessment or treatment planning. Cognitive or physical
disabilities might limit the type of standardized tests you could administer,
either because the client cannot understand the tasks presented, is incapable of
carrying out the required tasks because of physical limitations (visual impairment, loss of limbs or mobility), or the test manuals do not provide normative
data to compare results you might acquire by alternative means. Language barriers between clinicians and clients also pose a problem to be solved to effectively assess and treat individuals from differing backgrounds.
Another challenge frequently faced by clinicians is how to comprehensively assess and treat individuals who present with multiple symptoms and diagnoses. Although the repertoire of empirically validated and empirically
supported treatment options is growing, many of these preferred treatments
provide limited guidance for working with patients who are concurrently taking psychiatric medications or have multiple diagnoses. Lack of available prescribed treatment options for certain patient populations (e.g., individuals with
mental retardation or comorbid psychosis), therapists’ or clients’ constraints on
time, and inadequate money, resources, or availability to provide or receive the
optimal treatment needed suggest additional problems where brainstorming for
solutions will be particularly necessary.
Decision Making
If the rational problem-solving process was followed sequentially up to this
point, the clinician has identified the problem to be solved, goals, and possible
alternative solutions. Decision making comprises a set of skills to facilitate the
selection of the potentially most effective alternative solution and the construction of a decision plan. Solution alternatives are evaluated based on the anticipated or predicted consequences that might result if particular alternatives
were implemented. The selection process is based on consideration of the utility of each alternative (C M. Nezu & Nezu, 1995). The utility of an alternative
is judged by two factors: the likelihood of obtaining the identified goal, and the
value of the alternative, which is evaluated by considering the effects on oneself (personal effects; e.g., as a therapist) and others (social effects; the client
and those affected by the client’s treatment), and the effects likely to result in a
short-term and long-term time frame. Such anticipated consequences are evaluated in terms of a cost-benefit analysis. A rating system (positive [+], negative
[−], neutral [0]) allows the costs and benefits of each alternative to be compared when the analysis of all solution options is completed.
The Logistics of the Assessment and a Closer Look at Interviewing 201
Applied to clinical decisions in assessment, the therapist must consider the
utility of each possible means of assessing a client. If a client’s characteristics
seem to suggest a personality disorder, brainstorming would promote exploration of means to assess personality to identify the type and nature of the
client’s personality disorder. Review of assessment literature reveals numerous
assessment options: objective personality tests (e.g., the Minnesota Multiphasic
Personality Inventory, the Millon Clinical Multiaxial Inventory), projective
tests (Rorschach inkblot test), clinical diagnostic interviewing, and so on. The
assessor then needs to consider (a) the likelihood that a specific assessment tool
or a combination of specific assessment tools would confirm or disconfirm the
personality disorder suspected; (b) the personal effects the use of each test
would have on the therapist (what does the therapist need to do to ensure ethical, competent use of the test, how much time and effort would administration
take, and is this reasonable within the constraints of his or her practice?); (c)
the effects on others (the client and those affected by the client’s assessment;
e.g., what will the emotional or financial cost of the assessment be for the
client, and how will the assessment help the client in treatment planning? Is the
client dependent on someone else for transportation, and if so, how will the
time requirements of the assessment affect this person?); (d) the immediate
short-term effects of assessing a personality disorder in a particular client, such
as increasing the likelihood of selecting an optimal treatment approach for the
individual; and (e) the long-term effects (e.g., what ramifications will result
from labeling the individual as having a borderline personality disorder?).
Examples provided here only represent one or two possible consequences
under each heading. During the decision-making phase, problem solvers are
encouraged to think about as many predicted consequences as possible under
each of these headings, and to evaluate each alternative by comparing the overall positive, negative, and neutral consequences that exist for each possibility.
The goal of the decision-making step is to select the optimal or most effective
solution by finding the alternative that reaches the predetermined problemsolving goal, maximizes the positive consequences and minimizes the negative
consequences.
Once an alternative is selected, the problem-solving model (Felgoise,
Nezu, & Nezu, 2002; A. M. Nezu et al., 1997) recommends making a decision
plan. A decision plan requires the problem solver to consider the best means
(e.g., under what conditions or circumstance?) for implementing the solution
selected, and to develop a method to monitor and evaluate the actual consequences that result from implementing the solution plan. If home visits were
required for assessment of a child with behavior problems, when would be the
best time of day or week to increase the likelihood of observing the problematic
behaviors or troubling interactions? What equipment or observation recording
tools should the assessor bring along? These are just two of many points to consider in developing a solution plan for this problem.
Solution Implementation and Verification
The first three components (problem definition and formulation, generation
of alternatives, and decision making) of the problem-solving process are intended to collectively result in the selection of a solution. In the solution implementation and verification stage, the solution is actually carried out, and
202 Basic Techniques for Clinicians—Assessment
the resulting consequences are observed and evaluated in comparison with
the consequences that were previously predicted or anticipated (D’Zurilla &
Nezu, 1999). The effectiveness of the solution is determined based on this
evaluation, and the problem solver is encouraged to either self-reinforce
(“give yourself a pat on the back”) if the problem is solved, or troubleshoot if
the problem is not resolved. Details of these steps are incorporated into the
following vignette.
Suppose you have decided that a cognitive-behavioral treatment for social
anxiety would be most appropriate for your 22-year-old male client named
Gerry. This decision was made based on a thorough multimodal, multimethod
time-series assessment, and Gerry agreed with your proposed intervention.
When you selected this option, you considered the personal, social, short-term
and long-term consequences for yourself as the therapist, and Gerry—the
client. The predicted consequences of this alternative (in comparison to no
treatment, drug treatment, other therapies, or a combination of various options) appear to be largely positive across all domains for all individuals involved. The expectation is that Gerry’s anxiety will decrease in social situations
as evidenced by an increase in his ability to attend social gatherings, hold conversations with peers, and eventually ask others to join him for a social outing
(either a date or a group gathering). You also anticipate that Gerry will have a
decrease in negative intrusive thoughts about himself and others’ perception of
him, and that he will decrease his avoidance of interacting with others. As part
of the decision plan, you and Gerry created several self-monitoring forms for
him to use to monitor his thoughts, feelings, and behaviors.
Once treatment begins, these forms become the basis for evaluating the
magnitude of the intervention’s success. If the frequency of negative thoughts
and feelings decrease, and positive behaviors increase within a reasonable time
frame, and therefore, the anticipated outcomes and the actual outcomes match,
reinforcement of Gerry’s efforts and success is warranted. If Gerry does not improve as expected, and a discrepancy between anticipated and actual consequences occurs, reevaluation of the intervention (type chosen, manner of
implementation, etc.), and perhaps, the specifics of the assessment (circumstances in which change is required, or targets for change), is necessary to determine the interfering obstacles. Even if treatment is not successful at this
stage, clinicians are encouraged to independently reinforce clients’ attempts to
work toward their goals.
With problem solving and decision-making strategies in mind, let’s look at
the step-by-step procedural logistics of conducting a clinical assessment.
Procedural Logistics and Clinical Skills
How does one go about conducting a psychological assessment? The process requires two primary sets of clinical skills; gathering relevant data and integrating information into an explanatory case report. We are going to work
backward in our illustration, beginning with an example of the case report and
then detail how data were gathered and information integrated and used toward the initial purpose.
The Logistics of the Assessment and a Closer Look at Interviewing 203
In keeping with the problem-solving model, the following case report illustrates the goal for an intake assessment. The ultimate goal of an assessment
is to gain enough information about the individual (couple, family) to develop
an understanding of the person’s identified problem and what is maintaining
the problem, and to offer recommendations commensurate with the collected
and interpreted data to answer the referral question. This information is integrated in some written fashion in the client’s formal record of clinical service.
Particularly when the information needs to be communicated to a third party,
the clinician may prepare a comprehensive integrative report, similar to this
case illustration.
The following case report is presented in its entirety and then dissected to
show how information is obtained and then integrated for a specified purpose.
Readers should note that the format of this report represents only one model
of a psychological report, although it is a fairly prototypic example. Many other
excellent styles and useful formats exist. The description of Mrs. Giunardini
represents a composite case example to protect individual identities.
Psychological Assessment Report
Patient’s name: Gina Giunardini
Date of Evaluation: Wednesday, June 19,
Some Year
Date of Report: Friday, June 21, Some
Year
Identifying Information: Mrs. Giunardini
is a tall, 32-year-old, first-generation
Italian female, with dark hair and slim
build. She presented in casual and neat
dress, slouched posture, and anxiety
manifested by handwringing, fidgeting
in her chair, and pressed speech.
Reason for Referral: Mrs. Gina Giunardini
is a 32-year-old mother of two male children (9 and 11 years old), who separated
from her husband 2 weeks ago as a result of his extramarital relationship.
Three days prior to her clinical intake,
Mrs. Giunardini learned she is 2.5
months pregnant with her husband’s
child. Her gynecologist referred her to
the mental health clinic as a result of her
extreme emotional distress in response
to this news, and her self-reported confusion and perceived inability to cope
with the decision that needed to be made
regarding her pregnancy. The physician
stated that in addition to being “shocked
and scared,” Mrs. Giuanardini made several references to “not being able to handle things,” and “needing a way out.”
Background/History
Social/Family/Religious History
Mrs. Giunardini lived with her parents
until she married her husband, Anthony, at the age of 20. She had one
prior relationship with another male for
6 months. Initially, she and her husband
moved into an apartment, but returned
to live with her parents within a few
months because they could not afford
the rent. Mrs. Giunardini became pregnant with their first child within a year
of their marriage, and their second
child, 2 years later, at which time they
moved into the three-bedroom row
house where she and her children currently reside. She describes herself as
someone who “went right from being a
kid to being a wife and mother.” Her
mother helped her raise her children in
their early years. Mrs. Giunardini reports having had little social contact
(continued)
204 Basic Techniques for Clinicians—Assessment
Psychological Assessment Report (Continued)
with other women her age, other than
through playgroups, parenting responsibilities, and occasional get-togethers
with her husband’s friends and their
wives. She reports having no close
friends, other than her mother, her
three brothers, and her husband. Her
primary daily activities, in addition to
childrearing responsibilities, include
jogging, spending time with her parents,
and watching late-night television.
Mrs. Giunardini’s family of origin
consists of her mother and father, both
immigrants from Italy, and three brothers, ages 39, 41, and 42. She reports
good relations with all family members.
Her mother was described as “caring,
but she holds her emotions in; she keeps
the family in line. She can be stubborn
and touchy, but she’s had a hard life.”
Her mother has a progressively worsening case of emphysema, and has seemed
“depressed” for the past several months.
Mrs. Giunardini assists her father in caring for her mother, in addition to routinely cooking for her parents. Mrs.
Giunardini described her father as “a
good guy who doesn’t say too much. He
is stern, but loving and protective.” Her
parents have emphasized the importance of family and church, and, according to Mrs. Giunardini, have sacrificed a
lot on behalf of their children. Her
brothers are all married with children,
and reportedly protective and watchful
of Mrs. Giunardini; she sees them approximately one time per month. According to Mrs. Giunardini’s report, the
family embraced her husband Anthony
as if he were their “own blood.”
Mrs. Giunardini reports having a
strong religious belief system rooted in
her Roman Catholic upbringing. She
had always attended church weekly
with her family, until her separation.
She has not attended church since the
separation because her husband attends
the same church. Although her faith is
a source of strength for her, she stated
that she has not been able to “figure
out the lesson” in Anthony leaving her.
Educational/Vocational/
Occupational History
Mrs. Giunardini completed high school
at a private Catholic high school. She
states that she did not go to college because she did not have a direction for a
particular career. She worked for her father’s construction company by answering phones, until she married. Once she
married, Mrs. Giunardini states she focused on being a homemaker, but occasionally helped her husband in his deli.
Currently, out of perceived necessity,
she is considering career and educational options, and contemplates pursuing a nursing degree.
Medical History
Mrs. Giunardini reports no significant
past medical problems. Her two prior
pregnancies were unremarkable. A history of positive health behaviors regarding diet, exercise, minimal use of alcohol
(1 glass of wine daily) and tobacco
(none) were reported. However, Mrs.
Giunardini believes she may have gained
some weight (5 to 7 pounds) in the past
few weeks. Mrs. Giunardini reportedly
drinks two to three cups of coffee daily.
Mental Health History
Mrs. Giunardini reportedly participated
in brief therapy (1 month; 4 sessions)
with a social worker after the birth of
her second child, in response to a recommendation from her obstetrician/
gynecologist. She reported feeling overwhelmed, “a little down,” and “sort of

Psychological Assessment Report (Continued)
trapped.” Her ability to cope with the
adjustment of her growing family increased during this supportive psychotherapy according to her report. She
could not recall specific skills gained
during treatment. No other treatment
or need for treatment was reported.
Mental Status Examination
Mrs. Giunardini, a 32-year-old ItalianAmerican female of tall and slender
build appeared her age, was oriented to
person, place, and time, and was cooperative with the evaluator. Dressed casually and neatly with her long hair
tied back, Mrs. Giunardini maintained
a slouched posture and intermittent eye
contact throughout the interview. Her
speech tone was quiet and her speech
rate was pressed. She manifested anxiety as evidenced by her worried
thoughts, “I can’t stop thinking about
what has happened. . . . I am so worried about what will happen to us (herself and children). . . . My thoughts
keep racing about what to do”; and behaviors, including fidgeting in her chair
and handwringing.
Her mood was sad, anxious, and angry; her affect was appropriate to topic,
and she reported feeling “desperate”
and alone; she was tearful at times. Additional content of Mrs. Giunardini’s
thoughts revolved around her role as a
wife, mother, and daughter. She thinks
of herself as a “good mom and daughter,” and now questions whether she
has been a “good” or “bad” wife, due to
the circumstances with her husband.
She focused on her need to make a decision regarding her pregnancy (to
maintain it or not), how she would
manage to raise three children as a single parent, and what was “fair” to her
sons. Although Mrs. Giunardini stated
that she sometimes wishes she would
“go to sleep and not wake up,” she denied active suicidal ideation, past or
present. She dismisses thoughts of suicide due to her strong religious beliefs
and her responsibility to her children
and parents. No evidence of a thought
disorder was observed; short- and longterm memory is intact; hallucinations
and delusions were denied.
Mrs. Giunardini reportedly drank
one glass of wine per day, prior to
learning of her pregnancy; she denies
current or past tobacco or other substance use. Mrs. Giunardini is estimated to have average intelligence,
good insight and judgment. Prognosis is
estimated to be good based on past
coping history, positive response to
therapist, statements of feeling more
“hopeful” by the end of the session, and
willingness to pursue intense therapy
(crisis counseling) for the next 2 weeks,
and as needed thereafter.

Clinical Impressions
Mrs. Giunardini is a young ItalianAmerican female who has been raised
with traditional cultural beliefs emphasizing the woman’s place in the home
(continued)
206 Basic Techniques for Clinicians—Assessment
Psychological Assessment Report (Continued)
and family as a primary responsibility
and role. She has enjoyed and relied on
the support of her family of-origin,
husband, and children for social contact
and development of her identity as a
daughter, mother, and wife. She identifies herself through these roles, as does
her mother and sisters-in-law. She is,
therefore, experiencing extreme distress in reaction to the disruption of her
primary role as a wife, her “failed relationship” with her husband, in addition
to the reality that she is pregnant and
faces the possibility of being a single,
divorced mother who has not held
steady employment since her teenage
years. These major life changes present
the possibility of embarrassment to her
and her family, and the necessity for her
to reevaluate her strengths, weaknesses, and capabilities, although she
has not begun to do so. Mrs. Giunardini
has not contemplated or explored the
possibility that her marriage might be
reparable or that her husband might
wish to return to his family.
As a result, of these life changes, Mrs.
Giunardini has had many negative
automatic thoughts relating to poor
self-confidence (“I don’t think I can
handle life on my own.”), poor coping
(“I have no way of handling things. I’m
going to lose it. I’m going to fall apart.”),
poor self-efficacy for independence (“I
couldn’t make it on my own. I have no
job, no skills, no money of my own, and
no way of getting these things while I
am taking care of two or possibly three
children.”), and catastrophic thoughts
pertaining to others’ possible perception
of her (“Gina must have been a horrible
wife. Gina couldn’t satisfy her husband
or keep her family together. What did
Gina do to drive her husband away?”).
Her feelings of despair, fear, and anxiety
are related to the novel situation she
never anticipated experiencing, her perceived lack of ability to cope with the
situation, and her self-imposed isolation
from persons other than her parents,
since the separation. Her predominant
coping behaviors have included eating
more than usual, crying frequently,
avoidance of others, and seeking therapy. It seems likely that Mrs. Giunardini’s avoidance of others, her mother’s
poor health, which has rendered her unable to comfort Mrs. Giunardini in her
usual manner, and her pattern of panicked, anxious, and depressed negative
thoughts, feelings, and behaviors are
maintaining her current feelings of
helplessness and inability to effect positive action.
Mrs. Giunardini’s initiation of therapy
and her response to the first consultation/intake session suggests that Mrs.
Giunardini is open to gaining guidance in adopting more rational and
systematic thinking and learning new
coping skills, such as problem solving,
relaxation techniques, communication
skills, and other independent skills that
will aid her in accomplishing the new
life challenges at hand. With regard to
her decision making about the pregnancy, it is expected that Ms. Giunardini
will be able to arrive at an acceptable decision within the next week by attending
biweekly therapy sessions and following
agreed-on homework to facilitate her
problem-solving process. She does not
appear to be in imminent danger of
hurting herself or others (children, husband), seems stable to continue to reside
and care for her children (although she
was encouraged to seek familial support
for the next 2 weeks), and seems reliable
and trustworthy regarding her commitment to return to therapy.
The Logistics of the Assessment and a Closer Look at Interviewing 207
Reflective Questions
Now that you have read the comprehensive intake evaluation of Mrs. Giunardini, take a moment to reevaluate the report in the context of what you have
learned from Chapter 7. What was (were) the apparent goal(s) of the assessment? In reviewing the biopsychosocial model of assessment, were all aspects
of this model considered and represented in this summary report? What additional information would you want to obtain in a second session with Mrs.
Giunardini, if you had one?
Psychological Assessment Report (Continued)
Recommendations
Mrs. Giunardini was encouraged not to
make an immediate decision about the
pregnancy (within the first few days of
gaining this news), due to the tendency
for her emotions to interfere with rational decision making, and the potential
for regret if she makes an impulsive decision. As a result of cooperative problem solving in session, Mrs. Giunardini
was prompted to consider all persons
who could be supportive and helpful to
her during her decision-making process
(older brother’s wife, mother, priest, gynecologist), and evaluate the probable
positive and negative consequences that
might arise from her seeking their support in this decision. Likewise, in-session
discussion aided Mrs. Giunardini to begin evaluating both positive and negative
consequences to maintaining the pregnancy and giving birth, rather than only
the negative consequences that seemed
readily apparent. She was directed to
begin considering consequences for herself, her sons, her family, and other important persons in session, and complete
this effort prior to the next session.
Mrs. Giunardini agreed to record her
thoughts, feelings, and behaviors relating to her pregnancy, separation, and
future to help her to gain a better understanding of her responses to these
major life stressors, and to aid the therapeutic process in identifying areas for
change. Education regarding the connection between thoughts, feelings, and
behaviors, and the impact of her role
models’ and her own past coping efforts
on her current functioning were explained. Due to the complexity and
critical time frame within which Mrs.
Giunardini must decide to keep or terminate the pregnancy, she was encouraged to consider what areas of her life
would need to change if she chose
either of the two options, and to consider if these changes seemed at all possible (e.g., obtaining a job or financial
assistance, or seeking forgiveness from
the church and herself if she chose to
terminate the pregnancy), but was directed to postpone thinking of how she
would make these changes until later.
These recommendations were made in
attempt to focus Mrs. Giunardini, reduce her overwhelming feelings, and
break down her problems into a more
manageable framework. It was recommended to Mrs. Giunardini that she
consider others’ opinions within the
context of her own situation, morals,
and ideals, and that therapy would be
led in an objective manner, without
influencing her toward either decision
based on anything other than her
own rational and systematic decisionmaking process
208 Basic Techniques for Clinicians—Assessment
Because the report represents only one meeting with the client, the information is entirely based on self-report. What additional strategies or methods
would you choose to further the evaluation and take a multimodal, multimethod, multinformant, time-series approach to assessment? Based on Mrs.
Giunardini’s primary problem, would you have the luxury of conducting such
an evaluation in the necessarily limited time frame? If not, how would you decide what to include or not to include? Consider the problem-solving model of
clinical decision making in your exploration of these questions.
Once you have given these questions some thought, you are ready to proceed to the following sections on clinical interviewing and the procedural logistics of conducting an assessment.
Methods of Data Collection
Our discussion of the procedural logistics of assessment follows the framework
of the report previously generated. In this section, we address where information comes from and how we collect it. The strategies and skills described will
help you arrive at the information necessary to include in an intake evaluation
such as that of Mrs. Giunardini. Our discussion of assessment procedures looks
carefully at the clinical interview as a primary tool, and how the clinician integrates various methods of data collection into the clinical interview.
Identifying Information
A brief description of the client is usually provided in the beginning of each report to help orient the recipient of the report (other than the client) to recall
the patient. Likewise, if another professional receives a report prior to meeting
the client, it will help the professional identify the client on arrival. Identifying
information is usually gathered from the referral source and directly from the
client.
Reason for Referral or the Referral Question
Each client-professional relationship begins because someone (the client, a
client’s family member, another professional) has requested consultation, assessment, or therapy for the identified patient. The specifics of this initiation
are critical to planning what should happen in the first meeting and subsequent
meetings, or even the appropriateness of a meeting at all! Using the problemsolving approach to clinical decision making (A. M. Nezu & Nezu, 1989), the
first “problem” presented here is to concretely and objectively define the reason
for referral. Answering the questions “Who?” “What?” “When?” “Where?”
“Why?” and “How?” will help clarify the reason for referral.
Who?
It is not always clear who the identified client will be. If a husband and wife appear in the office together, is it because they are both seeking treatment, or is
one spouse attending to be supportive of the other? If a child is having problems
in school, is the child the focus of the evaluation or is the family unit the in-
The Logistics of the Assessment and a Closer Look at Interviewing 209
tended client? So the question, “Who is to be evaluated?” although seemingly
basic at first glance, may not be. There are other important “who” questions:
Who is requesting the evaluation (referral source)? Who is paying for the evaluation (the school, courts, self, other)? Who will receive copies of the final report? Who will provide the feedback to the client (the referring physician or
you, the clinician)? Who, if anyone, has explained to the client the purpose of
the evaluation?
In the case of Mrs. Giunardini, most of the answers to these questions are
evident. Some, however, are known to the clinician, but were not relevant to
include in the report. Knowing who will receive the report is important to direct the language used in the report and the amount of detail provided. Knowing who will pay for the evaluation is important for billing purposes, and if it is
not known ahead of time, reviewing these questions will cue the clinician to
handle financial matters before beginning the professional relationship.
What?
Probably the most important “what” question is, What is the goal of the assessment? The answer to this key question will ultimately guide the rest of the
evaluation. Remembering back to Chapter 7, is the goal to diagnose/classify or
describe the person’s problems or predict future behavior? More specific
“what” questions pertaining to the client’s problems and goals will further define the structure and content of your assessment: What are the reasons that
led to the referral? What is the client’s chief complaint? What is the referral
source’s impression of the client (if the client is not self-referred), including his
or her perception of the problem? What is the expectation of the referral source
for the visit (consultation, assessment and treatment, evaluation only, specific
testing), and can you meet this expectation? What is the client’s goal for seeking your services? What information can the referral source or others provide
you with to help you better understand the purpose of your assessment (previous records, recent evaluations, medical information)?
If you cannot gain answers to the “what” questions presented here (and
often you may not be able to), you must prepare yourself to obtain this information directly from the client. If a potential client speaks with you to schedule
the first appointment, perhaps you will ask some of these questions over the
phone. If you have someone who schedules your appointments for you or you
see walk-ins, you may have to begin an initial evaluation with very limited information, and ask questions to obtain answers on meeting the client. In the
case of Mrs. Giunardini, the gynecologist called the clinician directly, and
therefore, some dialogue allowed the clinician to gain the physician’s perspective prior to meeting Mrs. Giunardini. This was particularly helpful for the clinician because she could consider the parameters of her assessment prior to
sitting down with the patient.
When?
Many “when” questions can be asked. When did the problem begin, and when
(under what circumstances) is the situation most problematic? When was the
referral made, and how long did it take for the client to follow through with
scheduling an appointment? When does the assessment need to be completed
210 Basic Techniques for Clinicians—Assessment
to answer the referral question or aid the referring person? If surgical treatment is dependent on clearance from a psychology professional, it is likely that
the evaluation must be completed immediately to be of any value. If the referral person’s time frame is not reasonable given your practice schedule, the
client’s schedule, or the length of time needed to conduct a thorough assessment, the clinician must engage in problem solving to consider how this problem will be resolved.
Where?
At this stage of the evaluation, regarding the reason for referral, where relates to
both the chief complaint or problem and the setting in which the evaluation
will take place. Where does the problem occur (workplace, home, social situations)? Will the patient be seen in an inpatient or outpatient clinic, a medical
hospital, or physician’s office for the psychological evaluation? In the later sections of Mrs. Giunardini’s report, many “where” questions are answered:
Where does she live, or where does she participate in social activities? The basic
“investigative reporter” questions (e.g., Who? What? Where?) leading to a
clear definition of the reason for referral will be used throughout the evaluation process.
Why?
Why is the client seeking a consultation, evaluation, or treatment now (at this
particular time in his or her life)? This question addresses the motivations of
the client and the precipitating factors that led to the need for the clinician’s services. One might also ask, why is the client seeking the services of a mental
health professional (versus another health professional or other care provider)?
This is an important question to consider when a referral is made or when an
initial meeting is held. Perhaps, the client has little understanding of what psychologists or therapists do. Is there an expectation for treatment with medication or spiritual guidance? Has the person exhausted all other options and is
meeting with the psychologist as a last resort? Gaining the answer to this important “why” question serves as an impetus for conversation to ensure that
the client’s expectations are reasonable and the clinician’s understanding and
expectations placed on him or her are also accurate and realistic.
Mrs. Giunardini was referred to the psychologist because she was “confused,” perceived herself as unable to cope, and needed to make a decision that
was beyond the realm of the medical information her gynecologist provided to
her. Although the clinician agreed to meet with Mrs. Giunardini and believed
the referral was appropriate to her expertise, she also recognized that Mrs. Giunardini had strong spiritual and religious convictions that would influence her
decision making, and might require discussion beyond what the psychologist
could provide to her. Her recommendations included advice that Mrs. Giunardini consult with her trusted priest about matters that would influence her decision-making process.
How?
How questions pertaining to the reason for referral might overlap somewhat
with the why questions already presented. How can you help the client? How
The Logistics of the Assessment and a Closer Look at Interviewing 211
much interaction will you have with the referral source prior to and following
the evaluation? How much information does the client expect you to have
about him or her? How much information does the referral source want back
from you? How much information, if any, will be shared with other persons involved in the identified client’s problem? Considering these questions will remind clinicians of their legal and ethical responsibility to obtain informed consent
forms and release forms for any information from the client and all other relevant parties. These important documents are reviewed later on in this chapter.
By answering the preceding questions, and certainly any additional ones
that fit within this context, you should have gained a solid basis for your meeting with your client, and have established that you are an appropriate person to
conduct the intake or assessment. Having a clearer understanding of the specific
goal of your meeting will enable you to tailor your first interview to address the
relevant topics that will allow you to answer the referral question, or to identify what further meetings will be needed to accomplish this. Use of the brainstorming technique followed by decision making will allow you to formulate
your plan. Solution implementation is illustrated in the following sections,
which describe data collection and interviewing.
Background or History, Mental Status, and Information for
Clinical Impressions
In most reports that are generated from initial interviews, intakes, or comprehensive assessments, psychologists include the same basic components: background history, current mental status, summaries of objective and subjective
testing, DSM-IV diagnosis, clinical impressions, and recommendations. As you
can see from Mrs. Giunardini’s report, a lot of information must be obtained in
usually a relatively short period (anywhere from 30 minutes to 90 minutes, depending on the circumstances). Information for the overall evaluation may
come from a variety of assessment techniques (interviews, tests, questionnaires, inventories, etc.). However, all psychological evaluations require an interview, at minimum. Hence, the clinical interview is emphasized.
Begin with an Interview
Once the referral source has been contacted and you have clarity about the
purpose and goal of the assessment, the actual evaluation or intake begins. Regardless of whether you are conducting an intellectual assessment, personality
assessment, diagnostic assessment, or evaluation for some other purpose, the
interview should always precede any other formal testing procedure.
It is not recommended practice to initiate IQ testing on first meeting a
client, without first conducting an interview. Likewise, ambitiously presenting
Thematic Apperception Test cards prior to establishing rapport and gathering
basic knowledge of a client through an interview would also be inadvisable.
However, it is not uncommon for some clinics or clinicians to have patients complete pencil-and-paper questionnaires or inventories prior to their first visit or
while they are in the waiting room. Such standard practices allow clinicians to
obtain certain information without spending time in session to do so, or provide
a baseline of the client’s functioning or symptoms (e.g., depressive symptoms),
212 Basic Techniques for Clinicians—Assessment
prior to the first meeting, which may impact the client’s mood. The clinician will
likely review these responses prior to the first interview and then at least briefly
acknowledge their completion and content in the first meeting.
Conducting a clinical interview prior to formal testing serves many important functions. This first face-to-face contact between the client and professional allows the basic elements of structuring a session to take place (see
following discussion), and allows the development of a positive rapport. Interviews also often reveal new information that was not obtained by the referral
source or phone intake, prior to meeting the client. The course of the evaluation and your approach may change when new information is presented. Perhaps the client was too embarrassed to tell the secretary the true nature of her
complaints, and therefore, what you expect to discuss and what she actually
shares with you in your interview may be quite different. Or, the first interview may reveal that the client is not forthcoming with information, and therefore, standardized or projective testing might be necessary to gather
information that you otherwise would have gleaned from your interview. This
occurrence exemplifies when the clinician as problem solver recognizes the
change (solution verification) and troubleshoots, as necessary.
Interviewing prior to testing is also important to have some understanding
of the client’s way of thinking, feeling, behaving, coping, and responding to different circumstances to help conceptualize responses provided during formal
testing. Having such information will minimize guesswork and assumptions.
So, for many reasons stated, and many more that are probably not stated, it is
recommended that a standard, semistructured, or clinician-structured interview is the first technique used in the assessment process.
During or following the first interview, the clinician is advised to engage
in the problem-solving process again to determine the specifics of the remainder of the assessment. Decisions need to be made about the techniques, tests, or
tools to be used in the assessment, the length of time for the entire evaluation
(number of sessions, time permitted in each session), and who else, if anyone,
will be included or invited to each session besides the client. Even if the assessment is done in a stepwise fashion, meaning that the need for subsequent testing is determined based on results from initial testing, informing the client of
this projection will provide some general idea about the direction the process
will take. Outlining the assessment framework ahead of time allows the clinician to set realistic expectations for the client, the referral source, and him- or
herself, so that everyone can plan accordingly.
Often, new clinicians who have their assessment plans well designed in
their mind innocently forget to do anything other than forage ahead toward
their goal of collecting data! These clinicians forget to check in with their clients
and ask them how comfortable they are with the assessment process. Clients
may have concerns they will not volunteer without being asked, or they could
become fatigued and less present in the session. It is important to remember to
offer breaks during the evaluation process, if you continue beyond a 60- to 90-
minute session, and to check in with the client periodically. Also, remaining
too focused on one’s own plans, procedures, and questions to be asked can result in missing nonverbal behavioral information that could otherwise be easily
obtained through observation.
The Logistics of the Assessment and a Closer Look at Interviewing 213
Neglecting to request client feedback and missing observational data are
even more likely to happen if the clinician’s note-taking process becomes too
involved or distracting. Note-taking helps to maintain accuracy in recording details, but one must be cautious not to allow note-taking to become a barrier or
obstacle between you and the client. In fact, clients often appreciate and feel
more relaxed when clinicians inform them that the notes taken are merely
recordings of information they are providing, rather than the clinician’s analysis and opinions of what is occurring. Of course, this should only be stated if
true.
Goals for the First Interview
In addition to gathering information, clinicians are advised to attend to several
concurrent goals focusing on the clinician-patient relationship.
Establishing trust and a good rapport, socializing the patient to the assessment and therapy process, establishing professional boundaries and a confidential relationship, and a collaborative approach to assessment and treatment are
all critical goals worthy of immediate attention. Meeting these goals begins
with establishing the interview structure and keeping sessions focused; setting
an agenda; discussing confidentiality and gaining informed consent; and using
good therapy skills, such as asking effective questions, periodically soliciting
feedback, demonstrating warmth and genuineness, and being mindful of nonverbal behavior. Each of these topics warrants further discussion.
THE INTERVIEW STRUCTURE Once the general goal (diagnose, describe, predict, etc.) of the intake evaluation has been determined, the format of the interview is decided. Interviews may be highly structured or standardized, such as
interviews guided by the Structured Clinical Interview for the DSM-IV (SCIDDSM-IV; First, Gibbon, Spitzer, Williams, & Benjamin, 1997), the Diagnostic
Interview for Children and Adolescents (DICA; Reich, Shayka, & Taibleson,
1991), or an intake form according to the designated practices of an individual
clinic. Semistructured interviews allow clinicians some flexibility in determining the order of questions to be asked, the manner or phraseology to be used in
questioning, and in determining when more in-depth questioning pertaining to
specific topics seems relevant. Unstructured interviews refer to interviews that
are not predetermined in style, length, or specific content. However, interviews
should not truly lack structure in the more general sense of the term. All interviews should have a clear beginning, middle, and end that are evident to the
client and clinician and discussed in the process of setting an agenda.
To begin an initial interview, which is typically the first contact the clinician is having with the patient, proper introductions are important. First, the
clinician briefly states her preferred way to be addressed, and briefly describes
her credentials. Clinicians should also ensure that they are addressing their patients properly by pronouncing their name correctly, and using preferred nicknames or titles. Also, within an introduction, the clinician has the opportunity
to address issues such as time factors and note taking. Stating the allotted time
for the intake evaluation and future sessions, if relevant, begins the process of
establishing the client’s expectations for your work together, aids in structuring
sessions, and maximizes the efficiency of time-use. Informing clients about the
214 Basic Techniques for Clinicians—Assessment
purpose and content of note taking, as stated earlier, demystifies the interview
process and portrays the clinician’s intention to be collaborative. An introduction might proceed in the following way,
Good morning Mrs. Giunardini. I’m Dr. Smith. I’m a licensed clinical psychologist
and work at the Feeling Good Clinic full-time. Dr. Shilpa, your gynecologist, told
me she met with you, and that the past week has been particularly difficult for you
since you were told that you are pregnant. I am hoping that you are willing to
speak with me for the next 45 minutes to talk about your visit with Dr. Shilpa, and
any difficulties you might be experiencing as a result? . . . My hope is that by the
end of our conversation, I’ll have some ideas about how I might be able to help
you, or offer some suggestions about what services or supports might be available
to make things a bit easier for you. Would that be okay? . . . If you don’t mind, I
will be jotting a few notes down while we speak, just to make sure I don’t forget
important information or details you might share.
In review of this monologue, you might notice that the therapist stated
her general intentions for the assessment session, but was vague in describing
how these goals would be accomplished. Also, the client has not yet had an opportunity to state her goals or expectations for the meeting. If this session continued without attention to these factors, Mrs. Giunardini is likely to be unclear
about the assessment process, may not have an opportunity to express her
needs, and the session may not produce the results necessary for Dr. Smith to
fully develop useful clinical impressions or recommendations, as needed by Dr.
Shilpa. Collaboratively setting an agenda, after briefly exchanging introductions will help to ensure these problems will not arise.
SETTING THE AGENDA Agenda setting is common practice in many types of
therapies, especially cognitive, behavioral, and cognitive-behavioral therapy.
Much like your instructors provide you with syllabi at the beginning of each
course, and perhaps, an outline at the beginning of each lecture, agenda setting in assessment and therapy sessions provides a road map for patients and
clients alike. The difference between your class agenda and agenda-setting in
the context of a patient-professional relationship is that the patient helps to
create the agenda for each session. Clients may have somewhat less influence
on the course of formal assessments compared with therapy sessions, but intake sessions and interviews, usually benefit from collaboratively set agendas.
The agenda is a mutually agreed on schedule, established within the first few
minutes of a session, that delineates how time will be spent and what specific
topics will be discussed.
The process of setting an agenda should be brief. In the first contact with
a client, the clinician should provide a rationale for setting an agenda, explain
that agendas will be set in every encounter, and that sticking to the agenda is
the joint responsibility of the client and professional. Taking this approach to
each session ensures that the client will be an active participant, and that important aspects of assessment or treatment are reinforced, such as assigning,
completing, and reviewing homework. Providing clients with a rationale for
using agendas in each session is imperative, so that the high degree of structure
The Logistics of the Assessment and a Closer Look at Interviewing 215
and task-focused approach does not have an antithetical impact, such that the
client feels dictated, imposed on, or rushed.
PROVIDING A RATIONALE FOR THE AGENDA In clinicians’ explanations for
agenda setting, several points of information might be conveyed. First, explaining that setting agendas will provide both the client and the therapist with an
understanding of “what to expect” increases the likelihood that proper time is
allocated to topics that are deemed most important, while minimizing waste of
time. If the client needs the clinician to complete medical forms for the client’s
insurance, a request made in the last 5 minutes of a session may have little
chance of being fulfilled on that day. From the clinician’s perspective, agendas
minimize the likelihood that “surprises” will occur at the end of a session. Likewise, a therapist may intend to spend the majority of an assessment session
learning about the patient’s biopsychosocial history, without realizing the client
is pressed to make a time-sensitive decision due to an imminent concern, as in
Mrs. Giunardini’s situation. Setting an agenda allows the clinician and client to
state their intentions or goals and negotiate which goals are priorities. In testing
sessions during the course of an assessment, and in early therapy sessions, the
clinician generally takes more responsibility for establishing the agenda.
WHAT TO INCLUDE IN THE AGENDA When the professional-patient relationship is strictly focused on evaluation, rather than therapy, the agenda is somewhat more straightforward for each meeting. The clinician would first state the
amount of time allotted for the day’s meeting, and then proceed by outlining
the proposed structure for the beginning or continuation of the evaluation process. The clinician might first plan to have the client complete brief pencil-andpaper questionnaires to assess mood, frequency of symptoms experienced in
the past week, or other similar behaviors, followed by a 30-minute interview.
The clinician might then explain that he or she will be doing a series of short
tests with the client (Wechsler Memory Scales), and then plan to have the
client complete some computerized testing prior to ending the testing session.
Toward the end of the session, the clinician might plan to discuss questionnaires, self-monitoring, report-by-other inventories, or other assessment measures that he or she requests for the patient to complete prior to the next
session, or have a family complete by that time. The last 5 minutes or so might
then be reserved to allow the client or clinician to ask any outstanding questions that were not addressed earlier. In subsequent sessions, the first agenda
item might consist of reviewing homework previously assigned, asking followup questions to the preceding session’s evaluation, or responding to new concerns raised by the patient, the referral source, or a third-party contributor to
the data collection. Ideally, the client would have an opportunity to affirm this
plan and add or negotiate any additional requests for time use for that day. Take
a moment and imagine the script that might have transpired between Dr. Smith
and Mrs. Giunardini in setting the agenda for the intake evaluation.
OBTAINING CONSENT AND DISCUSSING CONFIDENTIALITY Clinicians old and
new often underestimate the importance and value of obtaining consent,
discussing confidentiality, and clarifying the goal and use for a comprehensive
216 Basic Techniques for Clinicians—Assessment
assessment. We hope that the following discussion will be persuasive enough
that you will not become one of “those” clinicians!
Although these three components of an introductory session seem routine
and standard to the clinician, they may not be familiar to the patient. So, aside
from the ethical and legal responsibilities, if attended to sufficiently, these three
core components of an intake session can help develop good rapport and open
communication between professionals and their patients.
OBTAINING CONSENT Gaining consent for assessment or treatment implies
that clinicians have thoroughly explained the purpose, goals, and objectives of
the assessment or treatment, potential client risks and benefits for participation,
who will have access to information obtained or produced from the assessment
(limits of confidentiality), consequences to discontinuation or nonparticipation
in the assessment or treatment process, and alternative options to those recommended by the clinician. Depending on the setting of the assessment (school,
private practice, community mental health center, other), whether the assessment is self-requested, initiated by the treating therapist, or a third party, and
the purpose of the assessment, the informed consent process may be more or
less formal. Formal informed consent is obtained through discussion and signing of informed consent forms that are often kept in the patient’s file, copied for
the client, and possibly sent to the referral source or intended recipient of the
evaluation report. If other parties are not involved, some clinicians may opt to
discuss the issues relating to informed consent verbally and accept the patient’s
verbal consent to pursue the evaluation, treatment, or both. When informal
consent is obtained, clinicians should always document that verbal consent was
obtained for the recommended course of the assessment or treatment. For clinicians in training, it is more likely that formal consent will be used.
When done properly, meaning that the clinician discusses each aspect relevant to informed consent, the client gains an increased understanding of what
to expect from the evaluator and the evaluation, and can ask questions that
might otherwise not be realized or addressed. Clinicians who routinely place informed consent on the top of their agenda may also reduce the risk of forgetting
to address issues of confidentiality or having a client become frustrated with an
assessment process that might differ from their self-created expectations.
To obtain informed consent, clinicians must describe the purpose and nature of the assessment. This introduction to the assessment often provides a
perfect opportunity to first have clients explain their understanding of why an
assessment is needed, and to give corrective feedback, if necessary. The clinician might ask, “What is your understanding of why Dr. Shilpa recommended
for you to visit me today?” In response, clinicians can correct misconceptions,
and then begin discussion by communicating their general goals for clients,
such as to understand their strengths and difficulties, which will allow them (or
the referral source) to provide recommendations to help the client improve
day-to-day functioning (coping with problems, reducing anxiety, “feeling better,” or whatever relates to the purpose of the assessment). More specific goals
should then be addressed, such as stating that the focus will be on trying to
identify the client’s confusion and memory problems.
The Logistics of the Assessment and a Closer Look at Interviewing 217
In Mrs. Giunardini’s case, the clinician’s goals were to understand why
Mrs. Giunardini was experiencing extreme distress relating to the pregnancy,
evaluate whether she had the resources to cope with this distress and make
necessary effective decisions, and provide recommendations to help her
through her perceived crisis. Dr. Smith was likely to modify her description of
these goals when stating them to Mrs. Giunardini, so that they would be appropriate to her understanding and sensitive to her situation. As illustrated, providing general, and then a more specific rationale helps the client to recognize
that an assessment is something that is done for clients, and with clients, rather
than to them.
Discussion of the purpose and procedures for the assessment also provides the opportunity for the clinician to highlight the collaborative nature of
the assessment, such that the patient is the expert in his or her experiences,
and the clinician is the expert in assessment or (insert the focus
of your work relating to the client’s difficulties, memory, anger management,
anxiety, helping people cope with losses or life changes). By addressing the
purpose, goals, and objectives of the assessment, the procedures to be used
(testing, biofeedback, interview), and the teamwork approach to be taken,
clients may already begin to develop appropriate expectations for the assessment process and feel more at ease.
Mrs. Giunardini immediately expressed relief when the assessment process was described, and attention to the uniqueness of her situation was acknowledged. Her initial misconception was that Dr. Shilpa thought she was
“out of control” and “losing it,” because she had cried in the doctor’s office. Although she endorsed feeling this way at times, she was concerned about having
these fears validated by a professional.
In discussion of the purpose and goals of an assessment, the clinician explains how the information will be used, and possible associated risks or benefits. In a forensic evaluation, the results may not necessarily be helpful to the
client, depending on the outcome. The client should know exactly what the
possible consequences are that could result from the data revealed in an evaluation requested by the opposing attorney. If the evaluation is related to a child
custody suit, and a Rorschach inkblot test reveals psychiatric instability, poor
judgment and impulse control in a parent, this information must still be conveyed to the referral source. To allow the evaluation, the client must be aware
of the risks associated with it prior to giving consent, and agree to the testing
under those known circumstances. Another potential risk of a clinical assessment might include the tendency for some people to become upset when questioned about sensitive or emotionally painful topics. In these circumstances,
the discussion of risks and benefits at the outset will help to foster rapport between the professional and the patient, rather than allowing the consequences
to ensue without prior warning. It also becomes more apparent that the relationship between the professional and patient in the context of an evaluation
or assessment can differ significantly from that of the professional-patient relationship in the context of therapy. The clinician who is only providing an evaluation is not designated as the person who will ultimately guide the patient
through the process of managing or alleviating his problems.
218 Basic Techniques for Clinicians—Assessment
LIMITS OF CONFIDENTIALITY Patients may automatically assume that confidentiality laws bind a professional-patient relationship. In many cases, however, there are limits to these boundaries. In hospital settings, patient
evaluations often become part of the patient’s medical record—a document
viewed by many health care professionals. Evaluations conducted at the request of school counselors might become a part of the student’s academic
record, and surely parents may gain access to students’ evaluations as their
legal guardians. Forensic evaluations have specific purposes and requirements for sharing such documents between plaintiffs and defendants as well.
Given these limitations to confidentiality, and many other circumstances
where boundaries are less clear, such as with insurance companies, clinicians
are obligated to inform clients of the scope and limits of the confidentiality
they can offer.
Contrary to the expectation that all information is confidential, some
clients fear or expect that their evaluation will be available to inquiring
spouses, family members, collaborative medical practitioners, or other parties.
Assuring clients of their rights and protections within the professional relationship may build trust and give permission to the client to be honest and forthcoming with pertinent information he might otherwise have withheld for fear
of repercussions. Clinicians who discuss the bounds of confidentiality and the
clients’ related concerns or questions can clarify misconceptions, set realistic
expectations, and establish the parameters of the relationship immediately, so
that client assumptions do not negatively impact the assessment.
RELEASE OF INFORMATION At some point during the assessment process, the
clinician may wish to speak with the client’s family, spouse, friends, teachers,
coworkers, or other health practitioners to gather additional information or
medical or mental health records. Likewise, the clinician will want to exchange
new information with medical or mental health professionals involved in the
patient’s care. Given the bounds of confidentiality, and supposing that the
client was originally ensured that information would not be shared with anyone other than the referral source, simply calling any persons in reference to
the client would breach confidentiality because they would automatically
know the client was being seen by a mental health professional. Clinicians must
present another consent form to the client to gain permission to have any interaction or dialogue with other persons. This consent form, often called a “release of information” form, specifies who will be contacted, what information
will be requested, what information will be shared, the purpose of the information exchange, and the time frame for which the release form is viable. If clinicians carefully review with clients the information they want to disclose to the
persons they contact, the clinicians can then honor any restrictions that their
clients impose. Enlisting feedback from clients in this process is both required
and critical to maintaining a good working alliance.
In the case of Mrs. Giunardini, Dr. Smith obtained her informed consent
for the evaluation, a written consent form to release information to Dr. Shilpa,
even though she was the referral source, and a written consent form permitting
Dr. Shilpa to release information to Dr. Smith. A thorough rationale for re-
The Logistics of the Assessment and a Closer Look at Interviewing 219
questing this permission accompanied the discussion of the forms presented.
Mrs. Giunardini had the opportunity to ask questions and feel comfortable
with the psychologist’s responses prior to signing these forms.
Data Gathering in the Interview: Asking Questions
A well-formed and strategically placed question is the clinician’s primary tool
for gathering information in the interview. Competence as an interviewer depends on one’s mastery of the use of questions. Using open-ended versus
closed-ended questioning while maintaining focus and control of the interview,
knowing how to prompt clients to provide more depth in their responses, and
being able to ask difficult questions requires much practice. Considering the
sensitive nature of Mrs. Giunardini’s problems, one can understand why a delicate style is needed, at times, and directive questioning and feedback is necessary at others. The following tips introduce you to these important skills. You
can practice these skills with anyone you know in the context of daily conversation—assuming you will not be asking clinical questions, or engaging in therapeutic conversation that could be construed as leading to a dual relationship!
CLOSED-ENDED, MULTIPLE-CHOICE, AND OPEN-ENDED QUESTIONS Before
proceeding, answer the following sets of questions for yourself; preferably,
write your answers on a piece of scrap paper. Set 1: Did you have a good day?
Have you had at least eight hours of sleep each night, for the past week? Do you
like classical music? Are you feeling sad? Set 2: Do you have difficulty getting
along with others or do you have a lot of friends? Are you happy with your
graduate program or do you wish you had chosen another field of study? Do
these questions seem simple, pointless, or curious to you? Set 3: How do you
describe your energy level in the past week? What activities do you enjoy for
recreation? What is your approach to writing term papers?
Review your responses and give some thought to any patterns you might
notice within each set. The first set of questions represents closed-ended questions, or questions that require responses of only one or a few words. “Yes, I’ve
had a good day.” “No, I have not had eight hours of sleep each night in the past
seven days.” “Yes, I like classical music.” “No, I do not feel sad.” Imagine having
a conversation in which the dialogue consisted of such exchanges. If you were
asking the questions, how much information would you have acquired about
each topic area? Most likely, you have not learned much more than specific responses to what you have asked.
Closed-ended questions are restrictive in the information requested and
obtained. Also, the questioner or clinician has to work hard to continue this
line of questioning when the responses are brief and not particularly informative. Each question could be followed up with another question, and if the subsequent question is also closed-ended, similar responses will be elicited. For
example, “No, I have not had eight hours of sleep each day for the past week”;
might be followed by asking if the individual has had more or less than that
amount. Again, a one-word response would suffice to answer the question, but
little would be known about the individual’s sleep habits or patterns. One can
almost imagine the volley of questions and answers that would be exchanged,
220 Basic Techniques for Clinicians—Assessment
using this inquisitive style. Such questions are typically asked in gaining a patient’s medical history: “Have you ever had surgery? Have you ever tested positively for Hepatitis C?”
The second set of questions represents what we call, “multiple-choice
questioning.” The questioner has intentionally or unintentionally designated
the appropriate responses available to the person being asked. For example, the
question, “Do you have difficulty getting along with others or do you have a lot
of friends?” almost forces the respondent to fit into one of the two predetermined categories of either having difficulty getting along with others, or having
a lot of friends. This question presupposes that the person being asked has not
just moved into a new area where he has not yet met many people although he
believes he can make friends easily and get along well with others. Likewise,
the following question presupposes that individuals could not be happy they selected their chosen field of study and not be happy with their program, “Are
you happy with your graduate program or do you wish you had chosen another
field of study?” To give a different answer, the respondent needs to contradict
the questioner’s question: “Actually, these questions do not seem simple, pointless, or curious to me. Rather, these questions seem to be unrelated to one another.” From our experience as clinical supervisors, clinicians who ask many
multiple-choice questions do so for several possible reasons: They have a specific hypothesis about what is going on with the client, and they wish to inquire about this hypothesis; they are concerned they are not communicating
their thoughts or questions clearly to the client; or they lack confidence in the
questions they are asking, and therefore, they might believe that providing possible responses will help the client understand them better. They have not
learned and practiced the skill of asking questions that provide more comprehensive responses; or perhaps there is another reason for this behavior. Asking
an open-ended question, such as, “Why do you ask so many closed-ended
questions?” might provide a few additional reasons!
The third set of questions exemplifies open-ended questions. To respond
to any of these questions requires information derived strictly from the person asked the question, without influence from the questioner about possible
responses that could be given. Furthermore, it is likely that more in-depth responses will be solicited by open-ended questions because the respondent will
not have been given inadvertent guidelines regarding the amount of detail
sought. Answering the question, “How do you describe your energy level in
the past week?” could result in the following responses, or a variety of others,
“I have had a lot of energy this week because I finally was able to catch up on
sleep after two weeks of sight-seeing”; or “I have had very little energy due to
the heat outside and my recent decision to give up caffeine.” These sample responses illustrate how open-ended questions elicit unbiased or uninfluenced
responses to questions, while also providing additional, possibly useful, information. Asking, “what activities do you enjoy for recreation?” instead of “Do
you like to play baseball?” will achieve the goal of gathering more information
from the respondent. Likewise, asking, “What is your approach to writing
term papers?” versus, “Do you make outlines before writing term papers?”
will result in a more comprehensive reply. Many clinicians begin their intake
interviews by asking patients, “What brought you in to see me today?” or
The Logistics of the Assessment and a Closer Look at Interviewing 221
“Why have you decided to seek therapy now (versus 3 months ago, one year
ago, etc.)?”
COMPARING OPEN-ENDED, CLOSED-ENDED, AND MULTIPLE-CHOICE QUESTIONS The three styles of questioning—closed-ended, multiple-choice, and
open-ended—each have pros and cons. Which type of question would most
likely be incorporated into a structured interview? Unstructured interview?
Semistructured interview? After reading on, you should be able to answer
these questions.
Asking open-ended questions helps clinicians gain more information from
clients by “giving them the floor” to speak freely about topics raised. Openended questions tend to direct the focus of an interview on clients’ stories and
personal information, rather than the clinician’s checklist of information
sought. The result is a more conversational style of interviewing and responding, and possibly more voluntary information and self-disclosures that inform
clinicians about subjects not previously considered. The drawback to asking
only open-ended questions is the risk that an interview can lose focus by allowing loquacious clients to speak endlessly about seemingly irrelevant topics,
or that only a few questions are answered within a predetermined time.
Closed-ended questions increase the likelihood that many questions can
be answered in a short time, but more limited information is likely to result.
Asking only closed-ended questions is likely to tax clinicians, unless the questions are gleaned from a structured interview. Likewise, interrogating patients
with mostly close-ended questions makes some patients feel rushed, not understood, or surveyed, rather than interviewed. Multiple-choice questions are
least desirable as part of most interviews, unless responses need to be standardized for the purpose of comparing answers to the same questions across individuals. Such questions tend to influence respondents’ answers because
automatic responses are seemingly stifled by the options presented.
Ideally, semistructured or unstructured interviews consist of a reasonable
combination of both open-ended and closed-ended questions. Beginning with
open-ended questions provides the greatest amount of unbiased information,
and then responses can be followed up with more specific closed-ended questions. Closed-ended questions typically dominate written questionnaires and
are less likely to be exclusively useful in semistructured or unstructured interviews. Multiple-choice questioning is only advisable when the questions are
derived with some basis for restricting the response options, such as in structured interviews.
Now that you have considered the differences among the three styles of
questioning, for practice, try to create open-ended questions in place of the
closed-ended questions to solicit more comprehensive responses. Next, create
closed-ended questions to focus an open-ended question for which you would
like to obtain a specific answer. Lastly, think about how your answers to the
multiple-choice questions might have differed, if restrictions were not imposed
on your responses. Throughout the rest of the day, focus on asking open-ended
questions in your daily conversations, since this type of question is typically the
most difficult for new clinicians to incorporate into their semistructured or unstructured interviews.
222 Basic Techniques for Clinicians—Assessment
The questions that follow illustrate some of the questions Dr. Smith used
to obtain information reported in the background/history section of Mrs. Giunardini’s clinical report. The excerpts follow the introductory portion of the initial assessment, where consents were obtained and the client’s initial questions
were answered. It is also important to note that these are just samples of questions, not the interview in its entirety. Questions were not asked in this order.
Some responses are provided to exemplify the types of answers given to openended or closed-ended questions.
Dr. Smith (Dr. S.): Mrs. Giunardini, although I have some information from
Dr. Shilpa, it would be helpful if you could tell me in your own
words what brought you in to see me today, and how you are hoping I
can help you?
Mrs. Giunardini (Mrs. G.): My life fell apart in the last few weeks. I’m so confused; I don’t know where to start. I need help figuring out how to put my
life back together, if I even can. My husband left me. If that’s not bad
enough, I’m 2.5 months pregnant and he doesn’t even know. I have two
kids, no job, and no husband. I don’t have anywhere to turn. I don’t know
what to do.
Dr. S.: It sounds like a lot has changed for you recently, and very quickly.
Since there is so much going on for you, we obviously won’t be able to
talk about everything today, so I think it is important for us to agree on
what is most important to talk about. Where would you like to start
today?
Mrs. G.: Well, the job, my husband—those things happened—I have to deal
with that, but I don’t expect anything’s going to change about over night.
I’m really most scared about this pregnancy. I don’t know what to
do. . . . I only have about 1 week to figure out if I am going to keep this
baby or not. I can’t imagine having this baby on my own, but then again,
how could I not have this baby?
Dr. S.: You can’t imagine having the baby, but you can’t imagine not having
this baby. (Reflective Statement.) Tell me more about the thoughts you are
having regarding this dilemma. (Prompt.)
Later in the session . . .
Dr. S.: You said that your husband just left you a few weeks ago. (Prompt: Reflective Statement.)
Mrs. G.: Yes, it came out of left field—he totally took me by surprise.
Dr. S.: Mrs. Giunardini, please you tell me about your marriage, beginning
with when and how you met Anthony, and what life has been like for you
since then? Here you will note that Dr. Smith asked a combination of questions to
get Mrs. Giunardini started in providing some background information about her
relationships. Dr. Smith needed some specific information regarding the timelength of the relationship, and the remaining questions were open-ended, but with
some direction to keep her focused. This question resulted in much of the information contained in the social/family/religious history section of the report.
Dr. S.: Have you had any other intimate or committed relationships, with
someone other than your husband?
The Logistics of the Assessment and a Closer Look at Interviewing 223
Mrs. G.: Yes, just one man before I married Anthony. As evident here, the closedended question only resulted in the specific information requested. As such, a
prompt (i.e., “If you don’t mind, tell me more about this relationship”) was needed
to gain more details.
Dr. S.: We’ve spent some time talking about your relationship with Anthony,
the birth of your children, and how you have been spending most of your
days in the past few years. (Summary Statement.) Let’s take a step a little
further backward. How would you describe your family members (parents, brothers) and what it was like growing up in your household?
When we first began today, you told me that one of your concerns is
that you have no job, and now, no husband to provide for you. It would be
helpful to switch gears and focus on this for a few minutes so that I can
better understand your situation, is that okay with you? (Rationale provided, and feedback solicited from client.) How far did you go in school?
(Closed-ended question.) Have you ever had any jobs outside your home?
(Closed-ended.) Tell me about them. (Prompt.) Have you given any thought
to what type of a job you might like to have, if you decided to pursue
work outside your home?
Keeping the Interview Going: Prompts, Reflective Statements, Summary
Statements, and Transitions
Questions obviously provide excellent means to getting patients to talk about
their problems, strengths, weaknesses, background, or most topics suggested by
the clinician. However, firing a straight line of questions at a client for 45 minutes or longer would get very tiresome and even grueling for most patients and
clinicians.
Prompts, reflective statements, and summary statements help to keep the
dialogue in a session moving along, without the patient feeling interrogated.
Using such techniques also reduces multiple-choice questioning and therapists’
tendencies to assume too much about what clients are thinking. Also, these
techniques help clinicians keep clients focused on important topics by emphasizing the portions of client responses that are most pertinent to the clinical issues at hand.
Prompts are brief, gentle suggestive comments made by therapists to encourage clients to provide more detail about topics already initiated, to (re)direct clients to focus on particular aspects of their stories, or to elicit more
complete responses. A client responding to the question, “What types of physical activity do you enjoy?” with the answer, “All types,” might be prompted for
more detail by the therapist’s incomplete remark, “Such as . . . ?” Other statements commonly used as prompts include, “tell me more . . .”; and “go on . . .”
Consider the excerpts from the preceding interview; can you identify the
prompts made by Dr. Smith? In addition to these generic statements, reflective
statements also serve as useful prompts during assessment and therapy sessions.
Reflective statements are statements made by clinicians that are essentially verbatim remarks initially made by the client moments earlier. These
words are repeated to ensure the client that the therapist heard what was said,
to prompt the client to expand or clarify what was meant, or to magnify the
importance of the comment. In the preceding dialogue, Dr. Smith reiterated
224 Basic Techniques for Clinicians—Assessment
what Mrs. Giunardini stated regarding her dilemma about having or not having
her baby. This signifies the importance of her comment, as Dr. Smith directs her
to talk more about this subject.
Summary statements are offered periodically by clinicians to make sure
they understand their clients’ reports accurately, to verbally affirm they are listening, or to gently interrupt clients’ speech to ask for clarification, change
subjects, or redirect the focus of the discussion. The following script is Mrs.
Giunardini’s response to Dr. Smith’s question, “Tell me about yourself, and
what your life has been like since you met Anthony.”
I am a 32-year-old mom with 2 kids. I lived with my parents until I got married at
20. My husband and I moved into a little apartment, but then we couldn’t pay the
rent. We moved back in with my parents for a few years. We had kids pretty
quickly and my mom helped out a lot. Anyway, I guess I went right from being a
kid to being a mom. My kids are now 11 and 9, both boys. My mom is really sick
now and I am helping my dad out with taking care of her. She has emphysema.
Between my kids and my parents, I really haven’t had much time for myself. I go
running every morning, but that’s about it. Usually, I’m just rushing from soccer
games to baseball practices for the boys, and then to my parents’ house to cook for
them. I guess I think of myself as a good mom and a good daughter, but I guess I
haven’t been a very good wife. I mean, I didn’t used to think I was a bad wife, but
I guess my husband thinks I am.
Dr. S.: From what I’m hearing Mrs. Giunardini, your life for the past 12 years
has focused on taking care of your husband, your children, and your parents, and those responsibilities have pretty much defined who you are.
You’ve managed to take a little time to exercise each day, but otherwise, it
doesn’t sound like you have had much time to dedicate to yourself. Now
that your husband has left you, it sounds like you’re beginning to question
your identity a bit?
Dr. Smith’s summarized what Mrs. Giunardini had told her by using her own
words, and adding a slight interpretation of what she thought Mrs. Giunardini
was thinking. The statement added to the end of the summary provides a
prompt for Mrs. Giunardini to express her thoughts regarding her current situation and her need for help in therapy. Of course, Dr. Smith’s decision to focus
on this aspect of Mrs. Giunardini was made in the context of the rest of the interview. Other clinicians might have chosen to inquire about other aspects of
her self-report, depending on what their clinical hypothesis was or the information they deemed necessary to obtain.
Topic transitions present a common difficulty for practitioners-intraining. Students are usually concerned that switching subjects might be perceived as abrupt, rude, or unnatural. They have difficulty interrupting clients
because they do not want their clients to infer that they are disinterested in
what they have to say, or that what they have to say is unimportant. This
common concern leads new clinicians to wait for an opportunity or segue that
may or may not come. To accomplish all that is necessary in an assessment interview, clinicians need to maintain some control of the session and guide the
The Logistics of the Assessment and a Closer Look at Interviewing 225
interview according to the agenda set. We have several suggestions for making transitions in session.
First, in the process of setting an agenda for the interview and shaping expectations for the session, the clinician might inform the client that many topics will need to be covered. A statement such as, “During the interview, I will
be asking you a variety of questions. Some will be specific to your reason for
being here today, and some may be more general questions that I typically ask
of people when I first meet them. So I need you to bear with me if my questions jump around a bit.” Second, if a client is very talkative and seems to be
providing much irrelevant detail in response to questions after the key information was provided, the clinician might gently interrupt and state the following, “Mr. Jones, it sounds like discussing this topic has brought back a lot of
memories for you that are very interesting. I would like to hear more about
this, but I am hoping it is okay with you if we discuss this again at a later time,
to make sure that we can cover all the things we need to discuss today. Would
that be okay with you? Is there anything else about this topic that you think I
should know right now?”
Many times a loquacious client is not the cause of difficulty in transitioning from one topic to another. In fact, clients who tend to give short answers, or
those answering mostly closed-ended questions, might present a bigger difficulty to new practitioners. If questions are answered concisely and without
more information than requested, little is offered for the clinician to reflect or
transition to the next topic. The third suggestion to aid in this transition is for
clinicians to acknowledge the switch in subject matter. In assessment of depression, a clinician might change subjects as follows:
I’ve asked you about your sleeping, eating, energy level, and physical feelings of
tension. I’m going to switch gears for a moment, if that’s okay with you.
(Client nods.) Besides having a lot of worries, oftentimes people who are feeling
down about themselves or their situations also report feelings of worthlessness or
helplessness. Do you find yourself feeling this way at times?
In this transitional statement, the clinician summarized the recent portion of
the interview, informed the client of the direction the interviewing was going,
and asked permission to make this change. Likewise, if a client had provided a
lot of detail within one uninterrupted response, the clinician might be concerned that the opportunity to ask for more information about the beginning
portion of the response was lost. Simply summarizing what the client reported
will validate the information obtained, will then allow the clinician to return to
an earlier topic. Dr. Smith might have replied to Mrs. Giunardini’s description
about herself and her life by making the same summary statement provided
earlier, and then continuing as follows:
From what I’m hearing, Mrs. Giunardini, your life for the past 12 years has focused on taking care of your husband, your children, and your parents, and those
responsibilities have pretty much defined who you are. Is that right? (Intentionally asking a closed-ended question simply to seek confirmation.) You
mentioned earlier that your mom has severe emphysema, and you are caring for
226 Basic Techniques for Clinicians—Assessment
her as well. Can we go back to that for a moment? Tell me more about what that
has been like for you and your marriage.
The two preceding examples demonstrate that noting the abrupt change
makes it less awkward, and relieves the clinician of having to find the perfect
moment or easy way to slide in the questions that do not otherwise fit into
normal conversation.
Difficult Questions
Even more challenging for new clinicians is the task of asking questions about
difficult or seemingly taboo topics such as suicide, homicide, sexual orientation, sexual functioning and sexual practices, drugs and alcohol, and hallucinations and delusions.
Many practitioners-in-training neglect to raise these topics in initial interviews; anecdotally, the most common reasons for this include “It didn’t come
up”; “It didn’t seem relevant to the reason the client was referred”; “The patient
didn’t give me any reason to believe that suicide (homicide, drugs/alcohol, hallucinations, delusions, etc.) is something to be concerned about with him”; “I
didn’t get a chance to ask.” The fact is, clinicians most likely will not be given a
chance to ask these questions, but rather, need to create the opportunity to ask
these questions. In keeping with the principle of forming clients’ expectations
for the interview, as described earlier, simply telling clients that some questions
to be asked are routinely asked of all patients will decrease personalization of
the questions.
Another technique that facilitates inquiry about difficult questions is that
of prefacing questions with statements that suggest others sometimes have
thoughts, feelings, or behaviors consistent with what will be asked. Doing so
normalizes the individual’s experiences, rather than creating suspicion or embarrassment for the client, as to why the clinician asked. Dr. Smith addressed the
question of suicide with Mrs. Giunardini as follows, “Sometimes when people
are feeling hopeless or helpless about their circumstances, they can feel trapped
and at a loss for what to do. When feeling this way, some people have thoughts
about hurting or killing themselves; have you ever had any similar thoughts?”
This closed-ended question will likely result in a “yes” or “no” answer. Dr. Smith
would then respond with more specific questions, if necessary. Suggesting that
others have experienced suicidal thoughts gives permission to clients to reveal
they have also had these thoughts, without feeling unique or deviant.
Questions of sexual orientation, sexual functioning (interest in sexual activity; pleasure gained or difficulty with sexual functioning; menopause), frequency and carefulness of sexual activity, and other sexual practices are often
more difficult for new clinicians or practitioners-in-training to ask than they
are difficult for clients to answer. Surprisingly, many physicians and other
health care professionals do not inquire about this facet of patients’ quality of
life either, unless it directly relates to patients’ chief complaints. Assuming that
reasonably good rapport has been established and clinicians are sensitive to the
background, history, and reason for the assessment, asking questions about
sexual functioning does not need to be threatening to either party. In fact, some
patients are thrilled that someone has asked them about this aspect of their life.
The Logistics of the Assessment and a Closer Look at Interviewing 227
Clients may have had concerns or questions they were not sure were appropriate to address, or may positively receive such questions simply because
they appreciate their clinicians’ sensitivity to personal preferences and individual differences. As such, the best way to approach such topics is to do so in a
straightforward manner, with the same tone, intonation, and comfort level
used to inquire about less seemingly taboo subjects, such as sleeping habits.
Here, some cognitive restructuring might be necessary for clinicians to recognize that asking persons about depressed thoughts or worst fears is equally as
personal as asking about sexual behavior!
The same principles and techniques recommended for inquiry about
sexual functioning and suicidal thoughts are also useful for asking about drug
and alcohol use, deviant behavior, arrest histories, and hallucinations and
delusions. Sensitive, yet direct questioning about these topics decreases the
awkwardness that could otherwise result from trying to slip these questions
in or indirectly assessing these aspects of clients’ past or present behaviors. A
common barrier to initiating these questions, besides feeling uncomfortable
with the practice, is making the assumption that the behavior or topic is not
relevant for a particular client. Therefore, asking questions directly minimizes
the chance that the clinician will be corrected for misattributions or assumptions that could lead the client to distrust the therapist. The moral of this
discussion also serves as a word of caution: Do Not Assume Anything About Anyone!!! Aside from the professional and ethical responsibility to be culturally
sensitive to clients, and to minimize biases and stereotype-based judgments,
clinicians are often surprised by the unassuming middle-aged professional
who reveals a long-standing habit of marijuana use, or the young law student
who reveals delusional thinking or non-drug-related hallucinations.
Ending the Interview
As the time draws near the end of interview sessions, clinicians are encouraged
to provide at least a 10- to 15-minute notification to clients to ensure that time
is allotted for proper closure. Clinicians may want to ask if any pertinent topics
have not been addressed, so that clients have the opportunity to fill in any
blanks they perceive, or initiate discussion they had not approached earlier. Clinicians might find it beneficial to ask the question, “Is there anything that I
haven’t asked you that perhaps I should have?”
Within this closing time frame, clinicians should also review data
they gathered to ensure they covered all aspects of their client’s life, relevant
to the chief complaint. Clinicians are encouraged to ask themselves if they inquired about all domains of the biopsychosocial model, including current and
developmental perspectives; the topography (stimuli, responses, consequences) of the problematic behavior and adaptive or maladaptive coping efforts, and information across situations and settings. Permission should be
verbally requested for clinicians to contact their clients, if further questions
arise in reviewing interview and assessment materials. Finally, clients should
be given an additional opportunity to ask questions, after clinicians review
the assessment process and the remaining steps of the assessment process
to follow.
228 Basic Techniques for Clinicians—Assessment
Collecting Additional Information
Once the assessment interview is completed, clinicians must review data
gained from the session(s) to ensure completion of material and to evaluate
hypotheses originally generated. At this point, clinicians continue with the
problem-solving process to evaluate what hypotheses about their clients were
supported or unsupported, and to reevaluate their goals and possible obstacles.
Using the brainstorming techniques in the generation-of-alternatives phase
of problem solving, clinicians should consider what additional information
or from what additional sources should confirming or disconfirming information be sought. Clinicians need to consider the possible utility of incorporating
other assessment techniques, informants, methods of evaluation, or time
points to complete the assessment to answer the overall referral question. Review of the methods and practices of assessment techniques described in
Chapter 7, such as observation, projective and objective testing, will remind
readers of some options that are available.
Drawing Conclusions and Giving Feedback
The assessment concludes with development of conclusions or recommendations based on the information that has been gathered. The next procedural
step is to use that information for feedback to relevant parties. Providing feedback is essential to completing an assessment. The information derived from an
evaluation is only as good as the evaluator’s ability to convey the essence of the
individual’s functioning to those who requested the evaluation, and to the patient, if relevant. The results and impressions from a formal assessment are
usually communicated in the form of a written report or a summary report,
and verbal feedback.
The Written Report
Where and to whom a report goes depends largely on who requested the evaluation in the first place. The main three scenarios for report delivery include
providing written feedback to (a) another treating nonpsychologist professional
who requested the assessment to aid in the care of the patient (physician,
school, courts or legal representative), (b) the client or the client’s parents (in
the case of minors), (c) the clinician’s own records, if the evaluation was intended to aid the clinician in the patient’s treatment planning, and (d) to another psychologist or mental health professional who does not conduct the type
of assessment required for this client.
Referrals requested by other professionals to aid in their treatments or
care of patients, obviously require formal reports with details about the assessment conducted, tests, inventories and questionnaires administered, diagnoses,
clinical impressions, and recommendations, if relevant. To release such a report, clients must provide informed consent and appropriate releases of information forms, as discussed earlier. These forms are required even if the referral
source is the reason the client ended up in your office.
When providing an evaluation for another service provider, it is wise to
clarify with the referral source which of you will provide the patient with direct feedback. This should be determined prior to evaluating the client, so that
The Logistics of the Assessment and a Closer Look at Interviewing 229
this information can be incorporated in the informed consent and subsequent
patient-evaluator discussions. In many cases, nonpsychology professionals appreciate their psychology colleagues conducting the feedback session and answering necessary questions, since such questions are likely to be beyond their
expertise. In other cases, the psychological evaluation was conducted as part of
a greater multidisciplinary assessment, and therefore, it might not be in the patient’s best interest to receive partial information separate from other clinical
feedback. Because feedback is critical, everyone’s roles and functions must be
clearly determined. Most importantly, psychologists have an ethical obligation
to ensure proper use of clinical assessment outcome data, and responsible care
for their clients.
Some referral sources recommend that clients seek evaluations to aid in
their own search for care. A physician might suggest to a client that the difficulties she is reporting about doing the schoolwork in her adult learning program
might signify learning problems. The physician might then suggest that a psychologist could evaluate her for a possible learning disorder; in which case, recommendations may be available to facilitate her success in school. The patient is
technically the end-user or end-recipient of the assessment in this case, not the
referral person. It is most likely not appropriate to provide the client with a detailed report because technical information could easily be misinterpreted or
misused, and possibly be harmful. In this scenario, it is likely that clinicians
would provide the client with a brief version, or summary, of the findings with
specific recommendations. The evaluator would maintain the formal report in
the client’s record. A summary might include a list of the tests conducted and
what their general purposes are, a diagnosis, a summary of clinical impressions,
and a detailed list of recommendations. Clients can always choose to have a
complete formal report sent to another professional at a later date. Formal reports, accompanied by appropriate releases of information forms, are sent directly from one professional to another. In the case previously mentioned, the
client may decide to have a report sent to her primary caregiver (referral
source), adult learning program, or guidance counselor, or not to send anyone a
report and independently follow up on the evaluator’s recommendations.
In any case, it is never good practice, nor ethical to provide clients or untrained (nonpsychological) professionals with raw data from evaluations, or in
many cases, numbers (test results) that are not easily understandable without
some sophistication and written and verbal explanation. Likewise, testing and
assessment reports should not be given to patients without providing proper
verbal feedback and giving the client the opportunity to ask questions, clarify
understanding, and discuss the findings with the qualified mental health professional. Verbal feedback will be discussed in more detail later.
Tips for Successful Report Writing
To be most useful to professionals and laypersons, reports should be clearly
written, logical, well organized, and user friendly. An assessment course, supervisors, and practice will provide you with various report models and development of your own report structure. The following tips are based on years
of review of helpful and unhelpful reports, reports by seasoned professionals,
and reports by clinicians-in-training. These tips apply to most types of written
report, regardless of the report recipient, referral question, format, or template used.
Some recommendations might seem to be incredibly obvious statements,
but we mention them here because we have come across more than a few reports that led us to believe that even what we consider obvious should not be
taken for granted. Reports should always be proofread and checked for spelling and
grammar errors. Yes, we have received professional reports that did not met
these basic criteria. Reports that minimize professional jargon, or psychology vocabulary that can be replaced by simple layperson terms, are easier to read and
understand and will be more helpful to most audiences. Overall, the language in
reports should be intelligently simple and not reflect heavy use of a thesaurus.
The structure of the report can be more easily followed when evaluators
use headings to guide readers through the report, or allow them to skip to specific sections of interest easily. Mrs. Giunardini’s report provides an example of
headings that might be appropriate for a clinical intake assessment. Other headings were discussed earlier in this chapter. While headings help organize a report, keeping report lengths within reasonable limits is also important. We
cannot provide an ideal length of report because this will vary depending on
the referral question, the depth of the assessment, the comprehensiveness of
the evaluation conducted, and the complexity of the client. Yet, while writing,
it is prudent to try to get to the point quickly and include only relevant information.
Consistent with the advice provided in the problem-solving model of clinical decision making, the content of reports should focus on facts and data, rather
than assumptions. A written report should provide the reader with knowledge
about how the results (what tests were given) and clinical impressions were obtained; readers should be able to clearly differentiate data from interpretations and
impressions. Clinicians are cautioned to be very selective about raw data that they
incorporate into a written report. Often, the raw data (numbers, test scores) are
of limited value to nonpsychologists or mental health professionals and can
lead to confusion, misinterpretation, or misuse instead of looking impressive,
as some might intend. Incorporating a few examples of relevant client comments and
description of behaviors can aid readers in concretely recognizing what the evaluator is referring to, and can almost bring the report alive—again making the report more user friendly. When standardized tests or inventories are used,
providing references and comparative scores (normative scores, population to whom
data was compared) helps professionals form their own impressions about the
findings. Similarly, reports on obscure problems might benefit from being supplemented with literature references to substantiate claims made and provide
the referral source with additional information to facilitate understanding. Discussing strengths rather than just weaknesses or limits is also important to ensure
that the report is balanced, does not present or create biases, and that the referral source can identify clients’ resources that may aid in treatment delivery.
Most importantly, the report must address and hopefully answer the referral question (the goal of the assessment)!
Many referral sources are most interested in the answer to their question:
“What is the problem and what can be done about it?” It is common for nonmental health professionals and laypersons to immediately skip to the clinical
impressions, diagnosis, summary, and recommendations sections. So be sure
230 Basic Techniques for Clinicians—Assessment
that if someone only reads these sections, the information presented there is
completely consistent with the rest of the report. Since recommendations are
typically most sought after, more extensive advice is proposed here.
Clinicians should always include a comprehensive list of recommendations for
the client across all relevant biopsychosocial aspects assessed (if faulty cognitions are noted, give recommendations to change them; if behaviors are problematic, interventions to target behavior change should be provided), referral
source (if relevant), and family or school system or environment (if appropriate). Recommendations that focus on what clients can learn to change or control are
most helpful, rather than recommendations that suggest changes in environment or significant others who are not contracted for treatment (spouse should
be less accepting of patient’s drinking and erratic behaviors; coworkers should
be advised to ignore hostile outbursts). In some cases, environmental changes
might be appropriate, especially for helping to change child and adolescent behaviors, or to assist in modifying behaviors of elder adults under residential
nursing care or home care by others. In these cases, evaluators might recommend interventions that require cooperation of patients’ social systems, if individual change is less likely to be successful through individual intervention.
Overall, recommendations, conclusions, and data must be consistent. No recommendations should be made that do not have some justification in the data provided. In other words, the recommendation to “increase social interactions
with peers” should not be made, unless the clinician has inquired about the
client’s social interactions, has data or self-report information to suggest that
current social interactions are insufficient, and that the current social limits are
impacting on the reason for the referral. Prior to any and every release of a report, clinicians ought to review the whole report and then reread the recommendations to verify that the claims made are justified.
Comprehensive recommendations are critical to ensuring the utility of the
report provided to the referral source. If clinicians simply elaborate on history,
background, and the details of the already evident problem, what to do about
the problem remains unknown. This is also why clinicians should not recommend
further testing if their role was to evaluate the client as needed. If further testing
is needed, evaluators should either do it or refer the client within the assessment process. In many cases by using the clinical decision-making model, evaluators can recognize early in the assessment process that they are not the best
person to accept the referral. In some cases, evaluators may later learn more
about a client and decide they cannot conduct necessary portions of the evaluation. These evaluators should make necessary provisions for the clients to gain
the additional testing or assessment, and then incorporate the additional information into their report.
Verbal Feedback
Patients require a thorough explanation of how diagnostic and clinical impressions were formed, what recommendations were made, and why. The utmost
care is needed to communicate sensitive results and troublesome findings. Many
of the same suggestions made for written reports are offered for the verbal feedback session: clarity, concrete and simple language, minimal to no jargon, logical
The Logistics of the Assessment and a Closer Look at Interviewing 231
presentation, and provision of a balance between clients’ strengths and weaknesses or deficits.
Clients are likely to have questions following the feedback session, and
clinicians should be available for these questions to ensure proper debriefing
and understanding of assessments. However, clinicians need to reinforce the
professional-patient roles; the professional should maintain the role of evaluator, not therapist, and not primary care provider. Clients at times may need direction following assessments. Similarly, clinicians must also be aware that
clients have various motives for assessment and depending on the outcomes,
may or may not agree with the findings. Clients who do not agree with assessment findings may attempt to persuade evaluators to change reports in some
ways, or may try to persuade evaluators that their impressions were incorrect
for one reason or another. If either of these scenarios arise, evaluators are reminded to rely on effective clinical skills to manage such sessions, and to use
the problem-solving model to identify problems, obstacles, goals, and solutions
to these problems. It is wise risk management to make note in the client’s clinical record of any points of disagreement that were discussed during the verbal
feedback session.
Verbal communication to professionals often precedes their receipt of the
formal written report. It is imperative that clinicians are prepared to provide diagnoses, brief clinical impressions, and recommendations when phone calls to
referral sources are placed. In other words, be prepared to answer questions
and provide substantiated claims, not first impressions or hypotheses regarding
patients’ problems. This advice is predicated on the fact that most professionals
are very busy, and while the formal written report will be useful to have in patients’ charts for future reference, they are more interested in getting their
questions answered immediately than reviewing 5 to 10 pages of psychological
prose. Also, time constraints might require their immediate action, rather than
afford them the luxury of waiting for reports to be completed and sent. As
such, important decisions are often made based on clinicians’ follow-up phone
calls, prior to receiving the entire clinical report.
Several years ago a graduate student returned a phone call to a physician
about the status of her evaluation with a patient being considered for a bone
marrow transplant. The patient had been ornery and noncompliant with nursing staff, and therefore, the physician was not optimistic that she would follow
detailed instructions pre-, post- and during the procedure. The psychology extern was consulted and asked to provide an opinion on this person’s candidacy
for the transplant, given what is known to be involved. The student called the
physician after an unsuccessful attempt to meet with the patient. She told him,
“I went to her room twice to try to meet with her and she turned me away both
times after very brief encounters. So far, I haven’t been able to evaluate her as
I normally have evaluated your other patients.” Before the student could finish
her commentary, the physician responded, “Thank you. That’s all I needed to
know!” The student nearly panicked because the physician was making lifeaffecting decisions based on her verbal feedback, without her intending for it to
be taken as such. Fortunately, she was being supervised in a teaching hospital
and the supervisor (SHF) could contact the physician to further explain and
evaluate the situation.
232 Basic Techniques for Clinicians—Assessment
Summary
Assessment and evaluation is a complex process that goes beyond knowing what
tests to give, how to administer and score them, and giving a diagnosis. This
chapter focused on the logistics of how to “put it all together.” The problemsolving model of clinical decision making (A. M. Nezu & Nezu, 1989; A. M.
Nezu et al., 1997) was offered as a logistical strategy to structure and organize
clinical thinking, and to guide clinicians in integrating complex information.
The case of Mrs. Giunardini, a 32-year-old female faced with a time-sensitive
life-altering decision, was presented to illustrate the procedural logistics of actually conducting a clinical assessment and creating a clinical intake report.
Procedural logistics of an assessment include socializing patients to the
clinical process and procedures, obtaining informed consent and releases of and
for information, discussing limits and parameters of confidentiality, and creating a decision plan for the approach to the assessment. Once these issues have
been covered, most assessments begin with some form of an interview. The
goal of the assessment, determined by the reason for the referral, will dictate
the type and format of interview that is most appropriate: diagnostic, mental
status or general clinical interview; structured, semistructured, or unstructured
interview.
Interviewing is a complex skill that requires much rehearsal and roleplaying, clinical practice, supervision, and critical thinking. Interviews are
most often the basis for all subsequent assessments, or serve alone as the comprehensive method of assessment. Clinicians, therefore, must learn to make
clinical decisions within the interview that allow them to keep the session focused, inquire about all aspects of the biopsychosocial systems model, maintain
good rapport and trust, and develop collaboration with the client. Throughout
the interview, clinicians are encouraged to be observant of verbal and nonverbal behavior, and clients’ reactions to questions, tests, or other interactions
within each session.
Discussion of Mrs. Giunardini’s case illustrated what we consider to be the
essence of clinicians’ interview tools—questions, prompts, and transitions. Attention to asking difficult questions was given, due to our witnessing the difficulty that many practitioners-in-training experience surrounding sensitive
topics. Interviewers were reminded to consciously review the data gained in an
interview session prior to dismissing the client to identify and fill gaps in the
data. Lastly, the topic of feedback was addressed, with suggestions for preparing
user-friendly written reports and for providing verbal feedback.

The basis of any psychotherapeutic intervention is the case conceptualization. In a useful conceptualization, the clinician takes the accumulated
data and forms a model for understanding and explaining the patient’s difficulties, as well as selecting and timing strategies that will be relevant and effective.
A useful conceptualization is developed and revised in a step-by-step fashion as
information is gathered and hypotheses are tested. The clinician shares this
conceptualization with the patient, typically using common language or illustrations rather than professional technical terms. In this way, the clinician engages the patient in self-examination and planning for change.
Learning Objectives
At the end of this chapter, the reader should be able to:
• Understand what is meant by “case conceptualization.”
• Discuss how the case conceptualization relates to the biopsychosocial
model.
• Describe the functional purpose of a case conceptualization.
• Identify five conceptual approaches or styles among therapists.
• Understand case conceptualization as an active process.
It is Friday evening at the Albert Ellis Institute in New York. Dr. Ellis is sitting on the platform with a volunteer “patient” from the audience. The volunteer is talking about how she has difficulty getting her schoolwork finished.
Ellis listens briefly and then responds:
238 Basic Techniques for Clinicians—Intervention
“You are being a perfectionist. You are telling yourself that you MUST do perfectly
well or there is something terribly wrong with you.”
“But” the volunteer patient starts to explain, “I need to do the very best that
I can. This is what my professors expect, this is what my parents have always expected, and I believe that I should not be satisfied with being mediocre.”
“Your problem is that you say that you MUST be perfect rather than accepting that you are a fallible human being and that if there are times that your work
is less than perfect, you will survive. If you said that you would prefer to do well,
but you didn’t always have to be perfect, what difference would that make in
your life?”
“I guess I wouldn’t always be beating myself up.”
“Yes. You believe that if you did something less than perfectly, it would be
awful and that it would prove that there was something terribly wrong with you.”
“But that is what I was always told.”
“Just because someone told you some nutty thing about always having to be
perfect, you don’t have to believe it.”
The preceding interchange could be viewed in many different ways. On one
hand, a fan or believer in Ellis’s approach to therapy might view this as an elegant
and parsimonious intervention. A critic, on the other hand, might decry the lack
of information gathering, the lack of rapport building, the lack of a therapeutic
contract, and the very directive and forceful nature of the intervention. The critics
would find fault and perhaps even resent Ellis’s apparent “shooting from the hip”
without establishing a solid database. If you can imagine being the volunteer patient described in this vignette, or perhaps imagine your best friend as the volunteer patient, how do you think you would react? Would you appreciate the direct
and incisive feedback, or would you want to run screaming from the room to
warn others to stay away? If you think the approach might be useful for some
people but not others, who do you think would be most likely to benefit?
We can also view the interchange as a superb example of case conceptualization. It would be incorrect to view what Ellis did as “shooting from the hip.”
Ellis’s conceptualization is based on two psychological elements (Ellis, 1962).
The first element is his basic A→ B→ C model of the relationship between cognition, affect, and behavior. The patient’s response to the situation (A) of work
requirements is influenced by her beliefs (B) about the need for perfection, and
results in her work-related emotional and behavioral paralysis (C). So the sequence is A = I have an assignment for school. B = I must do it perfectly well or
something awful would happen to me, and C = I ruminate and procrastinate
about it or spend inordinate amounts of time on the assignment, no matter how
minimal the assignment.
A second psychological element of Ellis’s conceptualization is the assumption that all problems can be broken down into three types of beliefs: (1) demands on self (I must be perfect), (2) demands from the others (They should
not make demands on me), and (3) the view that the world should be fair (The
world should be fair and equitable and not burden me as it does). With these
two elements as a base, we can see that Ellis’s psychological interventions come
quickly and clearly as a result of his conceptualization of the patient’s problem.
This is, of course, coupled with his 50 years of clinical experience.
Developing a Case Conceptualization 239
Contemporary psychotherapy has taken a decidedly scientific turn as we
enter the twenty-first century. The definition of the therapist as simply a good
listener whose job is to help the patient feel better has changed to the definition
of the therapist as an active and directive participant-observer whose job is to
help the patient to use empirically supported techniques to change and to get
better. Indeed, long before the advent of managed care, many therapists approached therapy by developing an overall conceptualization that integrated
multiple systems or levels of functioning of each individual.
What Is Case Conceptualization?
Case conceptualization refers to a systematic and comprehensive process of organizing and explaining the information pertinent to each patient. Conceptualization generally involves building a model that can be viewed and examined
in three dimensions and in multiple layers of detail. Whenever architects design a building or sculptors plan a large work, they build a model in clay, wood,
plaster or, more recently, as a three-dimensional computer model.
The model helps the artist visualize the various elements of the sculpture.
The architect can examine the size, shape, proportion, fit, and position of the
structure relative to other structures in the environment. Blueprints of the
plumbing, electrical, ventilation, and structural systems, as well as a layout for
finishing details such as paint colors and landscaping may be part of the model,
showing how all the systems will work together in one structure. Changes can be
made when the model comes out of the ether, off the page or drafting board, and
into the real world. The clinical case conceptualization does the same thing for
the therapist. The development of a treatment conceptualization is a matter of
psychological model-building. Without this model, the therapist is forced to fly
blind and to randomly attempt interventions without an order, focus, or goal.
Historically, psychological model-building has been based primarily on
theory. The therapist’s approach to case conceptualization reflected his or her
affiliation with a particular theory or school of therapy. The quality of the psychological model depended on the therapist’s skill and flair for applying the
concepts of a specific system. Contemporary conceptualization, however, has
gradually shifted away from a relatively narrow theoretical orientation toward
a broader, more comprehensive biopsychosocial model of human behavior. The
biopsychosocial model emphasizes scientifically grounded concepts and multiple layers or interacting systems to explain human behavior and psychopathology. Psychological factors do not exist in isolation from biological and social
elements of the patient’s life, but rather interact in ways that affect the whole
system. In the psychological realm, affect, cognition, and behavior are all dynamic and interacting subsystems that can be detailed as parts of the overall
conceptual model. All assumptions of the model either have a clear scientific
basis, or are posited as hypotheses to be tested for accuracy and validity.
This scientific approach to conceptualization is, of necessity, based on the assessment data from family and developmental histories, test data, interview
material, reports of previous therapists or other professionals, and information
240 Basic Techniques for Clinicians—Intervention
gleaned from the patient’s experiences with educational, legal, military and other
cultural systems. It takes into account the patient’s life context, stated problems,
strengths, and deficits. It is also revised as needed throughout the treatment.
The conceptualization must meet several criteria. It must be specific,
concrete, coherent, consistent, and reasonable. Conceptualizations that are
vague, global, and abstract are far less useful. The conceptualization must be
simple and parsimonious. The more complex, the less valuable it is. The conceptualization must have an internal consistency. When there are large gaps in
the conceptualization, the clinician must account for these gaps. To fill in the
gaps with theoretical constructs such as “unconscious” is highly questionable.
To concretize the conceptualization, it can be illustrated or diagrammed. This
picture or image can then be shared with the patient.
Even though case conceptualization is essential to effective therapy, it is
rarely taught in graduate programs. Instead, students learn about different systems and schools of therapy without necessarily learning conceptualization
skills. Then, as novice therapists, they learn a list of techniques for “doing”
therapy in a cookbook fashion, as if all problems could be addressed with the
same techniques applied in a formulaic fashion. To get some sort of result, the
therapist may resort to the “shovel” approach in applying techniques. The basic
notion of the shovel approach to therapy is that if enough techniques are
thrown at a patient, something may stick or work. A case conceptualization, instead, provides direction and logic to the interventions selected for the particular problems of a particular patient.
Functional Purpose of a Case Conceptualization
The functional purpose of a case conceptualization is to promote effective and
efficient use of therapeutic resources. If the therapist has a treatment conceptualization, the therapy will be proactive and not simply reactive. In fact, a conceptualization-based approach makes treatment easier. It provides the therapist
and the patient with a road map for their meetings and interactions. The plans
for therapy, the types of changes that patients can reasonably expect, and the
path to reach the goals all derive from the therapist’s formulation or the case
conceptualization. Rather than simply restating the patient’s words, or reflecting the patient’s mood, the active therapist will share hypotheses, use guided
discovery, encourage the patient, serve as a resource person, be a case manager,
and, in certain limited cases, be an advocate for the patient. Only with a clear
case conceptualization can the therapist confidently choose when and how to
apply these various intervention strategies.
We cannot assume that a single size (intervention) fits all and that just because a model works with one disorder (e.g., depression) that it will work
equally well without modification on another (e.g., anxiety). The treatment
chosen in one case may be contraindicated in another. Even if the disorder is
the same, the treatment plan for one person may not look at all like the plan for
another. Each treatment conceptualization is unique, reflecting the particular
details and specific issues of the individual patient and his or her circumstances.
Developing a Case Conceptualization 241
If the conceptualization is accurate, it will do three things. First, it will account for the patient’s past behavior. Second, it will make sense of the patient’s
present behavior. And, finally, it will allow prediction of the patient’s future behavior. Case conceptualization is essential to developing an understanding of patients, their life, their home and work situations, their interpersonal style, their
problems and the strategies that may be most appropriate for facilitating change.
The demands of contemporary psychotherapy often call for a time-limited
approach to therapy. This is not because of the forced limits of managed care
but because empirical data suggest that time-limited therapy is effective. Efficacy research protocols generally involve around 12 to 20 sessions, over a period of no more than 20 weeks. In clinical practice, however, the course of
treatment is not limited to 20 weeks. For certain patients, the length of therapy
may be 6 sessions; for other patients, 50 sessions. The length of the therapy, the
frequency of the sessions, and the session length are all negotiable and based on
the conceptualization of the patient’s functioning. The problems being worked
on, the skills of the patient and of the therapist, the time available for therapy,
and the financial resources must be factored into the conceptualization, and all
have the potential to dictate the parameters of treatment.
Conceptual Approaches
The novice therapist can learn a great deal by observing an experienced therapist at work. The experienced therapist often makes therapy look deceptively
easy. Supervisees frequently ask, “How do you know what interventions have
the greatest utility with a specific patient? How do you recognize the best time
to use a particular strategy or specific intervention? How far do you press a
particular strategy or intervention until you either revise it or abandon it?” The
simplest response would be the old cliché, “Therapy is an art form, not a science.” Students just have to study the art and, if talented, one day will magically “understand” how to emulate the master therapist. Alternatively, if they
believe that the therapeutic process needs to be scientific, they will examine the
process, identify the elements that combine for successful therapy, and evaluate
their efforts in a systematic way.
The conceptual approach can be related to the therapist’s style or philosophy of therapy. We can identify five types of therapist based on their conceptual
style, which transcends any particular theoretical background, training, or
practice. They are the theoretician, the technician, the magician, the politician,
and the clinician.
The theoretician is well grounded in the theory and research of therapy,
but does not believe that one has to gain skills in therapy to do therapy. They
operate on the assumption that if the theory is correct then the implementation
is a mere technical maneuver that anyone of normal intelligence can implement. These individuals spend their time teaching about therapy, discoursing
about therapy, theorizing about therapy, and researching therapy, but not much
time doing therapy. Instead, they focus on developing and elaborating a particular theory.
242 Basic Techniques for Clinicians—Intervention
The technician is the therapist who acquires specific skills, regardless of
the model. They can do therapy “by the book.” That is, they do a little bit of this
and a little bit of that, emulating the teachers whom they regard as masters of a
particular skill. They go to conferences and attend numerous skills workshops
so that they can enhance their bag of technical tricks. They do Gestalt work, behavioral work, and analytic work, and so on. These individuals often term what
they do as “eclectic.” What they lack, however, is a unifying conceptualization
of development, behavior, and approach to therapy. They try to do what they
believe works, without a healthy skepticism about the potential limits of their
methods. They view philosophical or theoretical discussions as distracting and
boring and avoid them.
The magician doesn’t need skills. They are charismatic, so that an hour a
week in their aura is, by itself therapeutic. Like the theoretician, they would
not think of lowering themselves by learning mundane technique. They don’t
try to emulate the experts because they believe themselves to be experts with
the therapeutic relationship. When pressed, they may label their work as “supportive.” They often pride themselves on having avoided extensive therapeutic
training, and focus on their ability to discuss esoteric therapeutic issues in obscure journals. In the view of the magician, the mental “laying on of hands” is
enough to effect a therapeutic change. They believe that therapy will just happen by force of their emotionally provocative presence.
The politician is technique and brand-oriented, and practices what is most
popular at the moment. Whether Primal Scream, marathon encounter groups,
or cognitive-guided disco-behavior therapy is used, the politician is on the cutting edge of political correctness and popularity. They are presently waiting to
see what is next on the horizon and will be first in line with the latest movement. They don’t wait for scientific results to accumulate; they embrace the latest and just move on when public interest wanes.
The fifth type of therapist, the clinician, combines some elements of all
five types in his or her philosophy of therapy and approach to conceptualization. The clinician has a theoretical understanding of development and behavior, therapeutic skills, an understanding of the therapeutic techniques that
work within that framework, and can develop and maintain a strong working
relationship with the patient. This type of therapist is far more likely to attend
both theoretical meetings and skills sessions at a conference. These therapists
are willing to combine modalities such as behavioral-marital therapy, and try to
develop models that are broader in depth and scope. The clinician learns about
what is popular and cutting edge, but evaluates the evidence before adopting
new techniques or methods.
The Conceptualization Process
The conceptualization is an ongoing process of formulating and testing hypotheses. The process begins with the first contact with the patient either directly, through significant others, or through a referral from a colleague. The
process will, of necessity, go through several incarnations. There will be the ini-
Developing a Case Conceptualization 243
tial conceptualization, followed by all the requisite revisions and emendations
made as additional data is collected. This data may come through patient report, or through the in vivo experience of the therapeutic collaboration. If the
conceptualization is cast in granite, the therapy will be limited and rigid. The
static conceptualization will limit the therapist’s ability to account for actions,
thoughts, and behavior that emerge in the therapy. With a rigid conceptualization as the primary tool for guiding therapy, the therapist is like the carpenter
whose only tool is a hammer, and every new development becomes a nail to be
hit with that hammer.
One difficulty in the conceptualization process for many clinicians is that
they accept patient complaints as problem statements. If a patient comes in with
the complaint of depression, the therapist has to help the patient identify the
problems that come together to cause the state that we have learned to label as
depression. The patient’s low self-esteem, pessimism, hopelessness, decisionmaking difficulty, decreased libido, or sleep difficulties are the problems. By delineating the problems and not focusing on the complaints, the therapist can
examine and evaluate causal or maintenance factors in the patient’s life for each
problem. Similarly, the patient who reports having panic attacks needs to have
the broad term of panic broken up into the component problems.
Effective conceptualization starts with the premise that behavior has reason,
meaning, and purpose. Behavior is not random, but is guided by what has been
learned, or what has been acquired through conditioning. Behavior is affected by
biological, social, and psychological systems and serves a function within these
systems. The comprehensive conceptualization will consider psychological factors
in the context of other biological and social information. In the next step of the
conceptualization process, the therapist develops hypotheses about the reasons
for a particular patient’s behavior in a particular context and what maintains the
patient’s thoughts, actions, and emotions. If on target, the conceptualization can
also suggest the course of therapy, the strategies for intervention, and the most
promising interventions. For maximum impact and effectiveness, the therapist
will build a treatment plan and then use a range of skills and techniques to implement the treatment. Specific techniques or combinations of techniques are selected to suit the purpose and goals of therapy, the therapist’s conceptualization of
the problem(s), the patient’s readiness and motivation for change, the resources
available in the patient’s environment, and the therapist’s skill and style.
Understanding Schemas
At the core of the psychological component of conceptualization is a grasp of
the patient’s schema, or cognitive templates for perceiving, organizing, and responding to experience. Some schemas are broad and include a variety of more
specific schemas (e.g., the schema for pets is very broad and might include a
large variety of creatures, from parakeets to tarantulas). Some schemas are organized around polar opposites, particularly schema for emotionally relevant
concepts. The schema for safety is highly related to the schema for danger. If
you happen to be vision-impaired and rely on your trained seeing-eye dog for
your mobility, then your schema for pet is highly active and your sense of
safety is associated with being near your dog. If your dog goes missing, this
244 Basic Techniques for Clinicians—Intervention
would activate your schema for danger. But, if you grew up in a family that disliked pets and feared dogs, your schema for dogs might include beliefs such as
“stay away from that animal or he will bite you!” Any dog, even a fluffy miniature poodle peeking out from a woman’s purse might trigger your schema for
danger. In the latter example, the schema for pets does not include an association to a schema for safety.
Operative or Salient Schemas
It is essential to understand the patient’s operative schemas. Particular schemas
may engender a great deal of affect and be emotionally bound by both the individual’s past experience and by the sheer weight of the time in which that belief has
been held. In addition, the perceived importance and credibility of the source
from whom the schemas were acquired plays a part in their strength and durability. There is a cognitive element to the schemas that pervades the individual’s
thoughts and images. With the proper training, individuals can be helped to describe schemas in great detail or to deduce them from behavior or automatic
thoughts. Finally, there is a behavioral component that involves the way the belief
system governs the individual’s responses to a particular stimulus or set of stimuli. For some patients, the sequence may be cognitive-affective-behavioral; for another patient, the therapeutic sequence would be behavioral-cognitive-affective.
Inasmuch as the schemas become, in effect, how people define themselves, both individually, and as part of a group, they are important to understand and factor into the treatment conceptualization. They may be said to be
unconscious, using a definition of the unconscious as “ideas we are unaware
of,” or “ideas that we are not aware of simply because they are not in the focus
of attention but in the fringe of consciousness” (Campbell, 2003).
Inactive schemas are called into play to control behavior in times of stress.
Stressors will evoke the inactive schemas, which become active and govern behavior. When the stressor is removed, the schemas will return to their previously
dormant state. Conceptually, understanding the activity-inactivity continuum
explains two related clinical phenomena. The first involves the rapid, though
transient, positive changes often evidenced in therapy, the so-called transference
cure or flight into health. The result of this phenomenon is that a patient with
clinical symptoms seems to have a partial or full recovery in a surprisingly brief
period and will then seek to terminate therapy as no longer needed. What we
may be seeing is the patient, under stress, responding to the activation of several
dormant schemas. They may direct the patient’s behavior in dysfunctional and
self-destructive ways. On entering therapy and experiencing the acceptance and
support of the therapist, stress is lowered, and the problematic schemas are deactivated. If, however, the patient leaves therapy without gaining the skills for coping with stress, the problem may reemerge when, and if, the stressor returns.
Individuals who develop effective coping strategies may be able to deal with
stress throughout their lives and rarely have dormant schemas activated.
Dormant Schemas
The second clinical phenomenon is the arousal of dormant schemas that cause
the patient to appear, on intake or admission to the hospital, to be extremely
disturbed. After brief psychotherapy, pharmacotherapy, or combination, the pa-
Developing a Case Conceptualization 245
tient appears far better integrated, far more attentive, and far “healthier.” In
fact, after the stress is removed, the therapist may question the existence of the
psychopathology.
The particular extent of effect that a schema has on an individual’s life
depends on several factors. The first issue is to evaluate how strongly the
schema is held. Schemas that are seen as part of the patient’s view of self are
likely to be more strongly held. These schemas are difficult to change as they
are how individuals define themselves and see themselves in the context of
their world. These compelling schemas are often easily seen by the therapist but
may be the hardest to address and change. After all, individuals who hold onto
their beliefs even after being threatened with death are labeled hero or martyr.
A related issue is how essential the individual sees particular schema to be
to their safety, well-being, or existence. Does the patient engage in any disputation of one’s thoughts, actions, or feelings when a particular schema is activated? This is related to the individual’s previous learning vis-à-vis the
importance and essential nature of a particular schema. Probably the most important issue is related to how early a particular schema was internalized. The
earlier the schema was acquired, the more powerful it will be, and the greater
effect it will have on the individual’s behavior. Layden, Newman, Freeman, and
Byers-Morse (1993) speak of the impact of an early internalized schema as
being in a cloud. This schema will influence behavior, but the patient may not
be aware of where the direction and power come from.
Case Illustration of Conceptualization Process
The following examples illustrate the building of a case conceptualization as
data about biological, psychological, and social functioning are gathered. In the
cases that follow, note the interactions between physical functioning, psychological perspectives, and role functioning and interpersonal relationships.
Example 1
Case Conceptualization
Following a Suicide Attempt
Alex, a 44-year-old married male was
referred for therapy by his family physician following a severe suicide attempt.
He had been hospitalized for a week. The
early part of the in-patient time, Alex
was in a coma. It appeared that a number of psychosocial issues combined to
push him over the edge. He was hopeless
about his perceived business failures, his
marriage, his health, and his finances, in
that order. He came for his initial therapy appointment directly from the inpatient medical unit. He had refused any
psychiatric consultation while in the
hospital, and agreed to the therapy appointment as a condition and promise to
the family physician. He came to the appointment accompanied by his mother.
First Data Point
His appointment time was 2:00 P.M. He
arrived at 1:45 P.M. with his mother.
Given these data, the clinician can begin
(continued)
246 Basic Techniques for Clinicians—Intervention
Example 1 (Continued)
to develop conceptual hypotheses. We
cannot be sure of the accuracy of the
initial conceptualization. This will be
confirmed as the data collection and the
consultation unfold.
Working Hypotheses
• Alex follows rules (he shows up on
time).
• He is a people pleaser (he does what
the doctor asks).
• He is dependent (he does what he is
told).
• He is unable to do things independently (he comes with his mother).
• He is overwhelmed by life (he made
the suicide attempt).
• He is emotionally estranged from his
wife (he is with his mother).
Can you think of any other hypotheses to propose?
Second Data Point
Alex was asked by the receptionist to
complete basic demographic information forms. After these were completed,
the therapist was informed and came
into the waiting room to greet Alex.
The therapist approached Alex, shook
hands. Alex stands up in response to
the greeting.
Working Hypotheses
• Alex understands social conventions (he responds to the therapist’s
greeting in a socially appropriate
manner).
• Alex fears being scolded by his
mother if he does not comply.
• Alex does not want to be embarrassed in front of the receptionist.
Can you think of any other potential
hypotheses?
Third Data Point
Alex is invited into the therapist’s office. At this point, his mother stands
up and starts to follow Alex into the
therapist’s office. The therapist asks,
“Can I help you?” She responds, “I’m
his mother.”
Working Hypotheses
• She views him as unable to care for
himself (she comes with him because
she thinks he needs her).
• She is a caring concerned mother
(she comes with him because she
does not want him to be alone with
a stranger).
• She assumes that she has license
to do what she wishes without
asking (she comes with him, and
starts into the office without an invitation).
• She blames herself for his failures
and suicide attempt (she comes with
him because she must now learn
how to fix her mistakes).
Can you think of any other working
hypotheses?
Fourth Data Point
The therapist acknowledges her and
states that he would like to meet with
her after meeting with her son. She
turns to Alex and says, “Alex is there a
problem in my coming in?” He says,
“No mom. It’s alright.”
Working Hypotheses
• They are enmeshed (he accepts her
presence because he does not see
her as separate from him).
• He is afraid of her (he accepts her
presence because he does not want
to provoke her anger).
Developing a Case Conceptualization 247
Example 1 (Continued)
• He is afraid of the therapist (he accepts her presence to feel safe).
• He needs her support to survive (he
accepts her presence because he depends on her).
• He sees the session as potentially
dangerous (he accepts her presence
to avoid something bad happening to
him).
• He is passive (he accepts her presence because he has no energy to
resist).
• They both want to make sure
that no family “secrets” are divulged. (He accepts her presence
because they both must abide by this
family rule.)
Do you have any other working hypotheses?
Fifth Data Point
Upon entering the office, the therapist
says to both, “Please, be seated.” Mother
sits in the chair next to the therapist and
Alex sits in a chair at a distance from the
other seats.
Working Hypotheses
• He wants her to do most of the work
(he lets her sit first).
• She will protect him (she sits closer,
allowing Alex to be at a distance).
• She sees herself as more central (she
sits closer, allowing Alex to be at a
distance).
• He is willing to be in the session but
does not want to be involved (Alex
sits at a distance).
• She will be the main worker in the
session (she sits closer, allowing Alex
to be at a distance).
• Few secrets will be divulged (she is
in the room).
• More will be accomplished by her
being there (she wants to make sure
that Alex gets help).
• Alex is gender-socialized to give the
best seat to his mother (he allows
her to sit first).
• She does not trust the competence of
the therapist (she sits closer to ensure that he does his job).
Are there any other reasonable hypotheses?
The reader might wonder why the
therapist allowed mother into this
first session. The answer is an important part of the conceptualization. By
allowing Alex and his mother to make
this determination, the therapist gained
important information regarding the
degree of power that mother had in
Alex’s current situation. To exclude her
would have spelled the end of therapy
at the outset. For therapy to continue
beyond Session 1, mother would need
to be “cultivated” as a therapy assistant.
To begin altering their system of interpersonal interaction this soon would
likely result in her sabotage of therapy,
either directly or indirectly, or Alex’s
failure to engage in therapy at all.
Sixth Data Point
When questions were addressed to
Alex, his mother provided the answers.
Working Hypotheses
• He is too depressed to speak.
• He is too afraid to speak.
• He has been told by his mother that
she will answer all questions so he
can conserve his energy.
• He is psychotic.
• He is passive aggressive.
• He thinks the meeting is a joke.
(continued)
248 Basic Techniques for Clinicians—Intervention
Example 1 (Continued)
Seventh Data Point
When the therapist addresses questions
directly to Alex, his mother gets very
angry stating, “Stop putting so much
pressure on him. Don’t you know how
fragile he is?”
Working Hypotheses
• He is too weak to respond.
• She is terrified that he will die.
• She was traumatized by his suicide
attempt.
• He is reluctant to assert himself with
his mother present.
Eighth Data Point
Toward the end of the session, the therapist asked Alex to have a seat in the
waiting room and he spoke with the
mother. Although wary, she responded
well when the therapist asked if she
would be willing to help the therapist
in working with her son. She agreed
and asked what she could do. When
told by the therapist that it was not
clear that Alex would return for a second session, his mother assured the
therapist (her new working partner),
“He’ll be here.”
The treatment for Alex would have
to focus on any, or all, of the following
with the agreement of the patient: reducing hopelessness, developing motivation for treatment, marital therapy,
assertive training, building self-esteem
and personal efficacy, and separating
from his mother. He is still physically
weak from the suicide attempt and
coma, and could benefit from time off
from work on a medical leave to fully
recuperate. Although he has had some
difficulty with his work and is sensitive
to perceived failures, he is still in good
standing with his employer. Both his
“failure” and his “alone” schemas have
been highly activated, even though his
perceptions in these realms are not entirely accurate. He has the family support of his mother who will be attentive
in looking after his best interests, and
his children are highly concerned about
his recovery. This initial model is open
to revision as additional data is collected and processed.
Example 2
Case Conceptualization
with a Busy Outpatient
In the next example, the same biopsychosocial strategy is used to build the
case conceptualization.
First Data Point
Case conceptualization begins with
an initial telephone call to the therapist’s office at 3:00 P.M. on a Thursday
from a prospective patient requesting
an appointment.
Patient: Hello, Dr. Black?
Therapist: Yes.
Patient: You don’t know me, but I was
referred by Dr. Smith here in Smalltown. He is a former classmate of
my primary care physician, Dr.
White. Dr. Smith said that I need to
see you and I would like to set up an
appointment as soon as possible.
What would be the earliest you
could see me?
Therapist: I have two openings. How
about Monday at 1:00 P.M., or
Wednesday at 11:00 A.M.?
Developing a Case Conceptualization 249
Example 2 (Continued)
Patient: Is that the earliest appointments
that you have? How about Saturday?
I could come in on Saturday.
Therapist: I’m sorry, but I’m not in the
office on Saturday.
Patient: Well let me see. Monday at 1:00
P.M. or Wednesday at 11:00 A.M. Could
you make it Monday at 11:00 A.M.?
Therapist: I’m sorry, but that time is
filled.
Patient: The 1:00 P.M. is late. I’ll take
the Wednesday at 11:00 A.M. Wait,
wait, could you make it Wednesday
at 11:30 A.M.?
Therapist: No, 11:00 A.M. is the available time. I could make it Friday at
11:30 A.M.
Patient: That’s too far away. I’ll take the
Wednesday. . . . No, make it the
Monday. Yes, the Monday. I have to
get my hair cut. Besides, Friday I
play tennis. Wait, do you think that
the later, I mean earlier, time will
open up? Oh never mind.
Second Data Point
One hour later, the patient calls back.
Patient: Dr. Black, is the Wednesday still
open?
Working Hypotheses
• The patient has difficulty making
decisions.
• The patient expects the therapist to
change to accommodate her wishes
and needs.
• Her needs and wishes supersede the
needs of all others.
• Therapy may be difficult in terms of
setting and keeping appointments.
• The patient views the therapist as an
employee.
Based on this sample of the patient’s
psychosocial functioning, it is likely
that therapy would need to include
limit setting for the protection of the
therapist and to offer structure to
the therapy.
The patient’s social skills, fear of
abandonment, dependence, obsessivecompulsive characteristics, and demanding behavior may all be part of
the picture that can be used to develop the conceptualization and then
become part of the problem list that
can be offered as grist for the therapeutic mill.
Sharing the Conceptualization with the Patient
Because the conceptualization guides the process of therapy, the working hypotheses can be shared with the patient using a Socratic dialogue. Rather than
interpreting the patient’s thoughts or actions, the therapist can raise questions
about the thoughts, actions, and feelings. In fact, the therapist who verbally communicates evolving hypotheses as interpretations runs the risk of appearing to
be mind reading the patient’s thoughts and intentions. Further, offering an interpretation such as “you seem angry” may evoke agreement from patients when
they really are more annoyed than angry. It may seem simpler to accept the therapist’s statement than try to disagree and seem ungrateful or contrary. The questioning format allows the patient to maintain integrity and allows the therapist to
gather the most accurate data. The overall case conceptualization is thus shaped
by developing and testing various hypotheses through therapeutic dialogue.
250 Basic Techniques for Clinicians—Intervention
Sharing working hypotheses can sometimes be problematic for the therapist. If a depressed patient asks, “Doctor, what’s wrong with me?” we may
have no difficulty in offering an explanation of the diagnosis. After all, one
can read about depression in any number of popular books and magazines as a
widespread problem that could happen to anyone. We may have no trouble
discussing or describing diagnoses of anxiety, panic, or phobia. The difficulty
occurs when the diagnosis is more serious (e.g., an Axis II problem). What can
the clinician say when the working diagnosis and conceptualization is Borderline Personality Disorder? Any reference to a disorder of personality is a potentially volatile statement and easily misconstrued. These categories are less
well known to the general public and are filled with many pitfalls. Is the problem easily solved? Can it be treated with medication? Will it last forever? Can
therapy cure this disorder? What motivation is necessary to cure or help this
problem? How long will it take? Where does it come from and whose fault is
it? Why is this necessarily true about me? These are all reasonable questions.
We can be evasive and take the position that these questions can only be
answered over the long term of the therapy. If we are conceptualizing the patient’s problems as Axis II, we know that the problem is generally more difficult to work with, motivation is low, medication is not generally useful, and so
on (A. T. Beck et al., 2004). Because of problems in defining the Axis II categories, the sharing of a diagnostic label is probably less helpful to the patient
than a descriptive explanation of specific problems. However, it is essential to
share the conceptualization so that the patient can know what the therapist is
seeing and direction of the therapy.
Using reframing, the therapist can share the conceptualization that provides a basis for understanding and organizing the symptoms and struggles of
the patient, while still showing respect and regard for the patient’s autonomy.
In working with the schizoid patient, the therapist can highlight the patient’s
independence: “You tend to like doing things on your own.” For the dependent
patient, the therapist can say, “You prefer to have lots of others around you,” or
“You generally try to arrange your life to have consultants or people you can
call on to help you make decisions.” The patient can then be asked whether this
is congruent with their personal view.
The working hypotheses are shared with the patient to foster understanding and collaboration on the most useful approach to change. One technique
for sharing hypotheses is for therapists to make sketches of how they “see” the
patient. These sketches force the therapist to graphically and concretely look at
their conceptualization, to simplify it, and to share that model with the patient.
Consider the following illustrations of sharing the working hypotheses.
Sharing a Working Hypothesis: Don (Vignette 1)
Don, a 52-year-old attorney came for
therapy with diagnoses of avoidant
personality disorder, obsessive compulsive personality disorder, and generalized anxiety disorder. He spent
great blocks of time in activities that
he recognized as wasted effort, yet
necessary in his view. The therapist
drew the following sketch with an explanation (Figure 9.1).

Search for
Safe
Crossing
Sharing a Working Hypothesis: Don (Vignette 1) (Continued)
Therapist: What you describe is a life
where you want to cross the road.
But you’re afraid that a car will race
down and run you over. So to avoid
that situation, you run a mile to
your left to see if there are any cars
coming. If there are none, you return to your starting point. But you
cannot cross yet, because there may
be danger. You still cannot cross the
road because while you were off to
the left, a car may be coming from
the right. So you spend your life
running miles, but never crossing
the 20 feet of road. The goal of therapy will be to help you find a safe
crossing without so much wasted
effort.
Figure 9.2
A Tenuous
Balance
Sharing a Working Hypothesis: Alicia (Vignette 2)
Alicia, a 29-year-old woman was diagnosed with borderline personality disorder. She reported that any stressor
would cause her to “explode.” She had
great difficulty in interpersonal relationships. She appeared to have a
very tenuous balance that was easily
shaken.
The therapist drew the following Figure 9.2).
Therapist: From what you describe, your
life is very difficult. You end up balanced on the pinnacle of the mountain. Most of your energy is spent on
maintaining your balance so as to
avoid falling off the mountain and
being injured or killed.
The patient looked at the drawing
and stated, “That’s exactly how I feel.”
The therapeutic goal is to help Alicia
to have a firmer, more solid base.
252 Basic Techniques for Clinicians—Intervention
Figure 9.3
Family

Structure
Sharing a Working Hypothesis: Marion (Vignette 3)
Marion was the identified patient. She
was 10 years old and was referred by the
school because she had developed a pattern of intimidating others. She tried to
intimidate the teachers and all the children in her class. She would take or
break another child’s things if she did
not get her way. She would throw
tantrums in the classroom if the teacher
frustrated her wishes.
On interviewing the parents, it was
clear that Marion did the same thing at
home. She intimidated her mother and
frightened her younger brother. Her father’s response was to leave for work
early in the morning and return late at
night. He chose to leave the management of Marion to his wife. This was a
task that was difficult for two people,
impossible for one.
The therapist drew the following picture (Figure 9.3).
Therapist: Mother and brother are under
the child’s control. The child is the
biggest figure by virtue of having so
much power. Father is out of the picture. The goals of therapy, in sequence, would be, first, bring father
into the family. Second, bring mother
out from underfoot and have her
team up with father to increase their
power. This would involve helping
them develop more collaborative and
effective parenting skills. The third
step would be to try to help Marion
attain power from less dysfunctional
behaviors. If, instead, the therapist
tried to “shrink” Marion by taking
away some of her power, a struggle
would ensue. If the goal was to empower mother to remove herself from
underfoot without father there to
support her, she would likely be
pushed down again by the child.
However, if father were not available,
the therapist would need to seek resources to support mother. These
might include involving family,
friends, or a support group as supporters. The therapist could be an important support for mother, were
father not available.
Impact of Sharing the Conceptualization
As the therapist begins to share the working hypotheses and further develop
the case conceptualization in partnership with the patient, we can expect
that there will be an impact on the patient. Sharing a conceptualization is
a powerful action that can and likely will destabilize the patient’s familiar patterns. The hope is that this will promote psychological growth and
change.
According to dynamic systems theorists (Caspar, Rothenfluh, & Segal,
1992; L. S. Greenberg, Rice, & Elliott, 1993; Mahoney, 1991; Schiepek,
Fricke, & Kaimer, 1992), psychological growth is a lifelong process that is
characterized by periods of stability and instability. Psychopathology, like any
state of being, is viewed as a state of dynamic equilibrium, where the predominant state consists of well organized patterns of cognitive/affective/behavioral and somatic functioning that interfere with the individual’s
well-being and everyday adaptive functioning (Mahoney, 1991). Destabilization is viewed as a necessary and natural process that allows for growth and
change. It is through this “shaking up” process that change can occur. Mahoney (1991) described destabilization as a period of systemwide disorder
marked by increased variability in such domains as thought patterns, affect,
behavior, intimacy, sleep, appetite, and somatic functioning. Given the organism’s natural movement toward stability and balance, the system in disorder
will attempt to move toward order.
In Mahoney’s (1991) dynamic systems perspective, it is natural and
healthy for an individual to resist moving too far and too quickly beyond
familiar patterns, even if those patterns interfere with functioning and
cause distress. Freeman and Leaf (1989) use the metaphor of a safety zone
in explaining the change-related discomfort or avoidance phenomenon.
Normally, each individual lives in a safety zone. The boundaries of the safety
zone are often fairly well defined. For some individuals, the limits of the
safety zone may be the walls of their house or the fence in the front yard.
For others, the safety zone may be defined by certain people or limited
emotional states. Anything outside the safety zone is labeled by the individual as “dangerous” or “threatening.” Approaching the boundaries of the
safety zone will elicit a withdrawal, avoidance, or safety-seeking response. If
the individual stays well within the safety zone, there will be minimum
anxiety.
Movement toward reestablishing order in light of the new conceptualization will occur first by using old, well-established patterns (assimilation),
and if these more practiced behaviors do not work, small incremental
changes will follow (accommodation). Ideally, the therapist can guide and
shape the accommodations by providing the setting (a safe one), the skills
(increased repertoire of techniques), and the support (encouragement of risk
taking) needed for this difficult task. Providing a secure, supportive therapeutic environment and strengthening internal and external resources
can prepare the patient to undergo the destabilization that accompanies reexamining and reorganizing one’s concepts about oneself, other people, and
one’s future.
Developing a Case Conceptualization 253
Summary
The highest order cognitive skill in psychotherapy is the ability to develop
treatment conceptualizations. Too often, therapy is a reactive process; the
therapist responds to what the patient brings into the therapy or the specific
session. Proactive therapy involves a careful evaluation of the patient’s
problems based on a synthesis of the relevant data. Different therapists have
different styles or approaches to building a case conceptualization. The
clinician is the most thorough, incorporating some modified elements of
the more limited styles of the theoretician, the magician, the politician, or
the technician into a more comprehensive and systematic, scientifically
grounded approach.
Case conceptualization is a process of organizing and comprehending
information about each patient. It is based on data and considers the interacting biological, psychological, and social systems of the individual. The
functional purpose of the case conceptualization is to promote the effective
and efficient use of therapeutic resources. The conceptualization begins with
the first bits of information, and as information accumulates, the therapist
develops working hypotheses about why the patients respond the way they
do, what were probable formative elements in the style, what are the operative schemas, and what are the best possible points of entry into the system.
The therapist then shares these working hypotheses with the patient to
gather more information and shape the overall conceptualization. The evolving conceptualization is a guide for determining direction and targets for
therapy.
The core psychological construct in the conceptualization is the patient’s
schemas. The schemas are the organizing templates through which perception
is built. Many schemas occur in complex combinations and permutations. The
schemas may be personal, family, religious, cultural, age-related, or gender related, or any combination of these factors. The schemas become, in effect, how
one defines oneself, both individually, and as part of a group. Schemas are in a
constant state of change, evolution, and activation or deactivation. From the
child’s earliest years, there is a need to alter old schemas and develop new ones
to meet the different and increasingly complex demands of the world. Schemas
are not maladaptive per se, no matter how they are stated. The expression of
the schemas in the person’s life, and the goodness of fit with personal goals and
skills, and with societal expectations are primary concerns in schema activation
and modification.
Working hypotheses provide a concrete way to share the schema
conceptualizations with the patient. This allows the patient to understand
what the therapist understands of their problem and fosters their collaboration on building the most useful conceptualization and approach to change.
A technique for sharing working hypotheses is for therapists to sketch
how they perceive their patients’ problems with some form of metaphor or
graphic example.
When patients are engaged in conceptualizing their own functioning in
new ways, some degree of destabilization can be anticipated. The therapist
254 Basic Techniques for Clinicians—Intervention
needs to provide structure and support during this process, and understand that
disturbance in the system will produce predictable efforts to reestablish order.
Guiding these efforts within a safe environment is a crucial therapeutic task.
Conceptualization is the backbone of effective and efficient therapy. With
an accurate initial conceptualization, the clinician will be well prepared to implement the subsequent steps of establishing and maintaining a working relationship, selecting intervention techniques, and guiding the overall process of
change.

Chapter
Developing a Treatment Plan:
Therapeutic Alliance and
Collaborative Goals
Once the clinician has a basic conceptualization of the patient’s difficulties, the next question is, “Where do we go from here?” Two essential elements are needed to establish this direction: A directed plan for treatment and
a collaborating relationship between or among the participants.
Learning Objectives
At the end of this chapter, the reader should be able to:
• Understand the collaborative roles of patient and therapist in a working
alliance.
• Identify three core collaboration skills, why they are important, and how
they are acquired.
• Translate chief complaints into measurable goals.
• Develop a problem list and a comprehensive treatment plan.
• List five techniques for building and maintaining the therapeutic relationship.
• Identify relationship beliefs that interfere with collaboration.
• Identify five indications of a good working relationship.
As we move from the abstract task of conceptualization into a practical
application of treatment methods, it is important to recognize that several participants may have a stake in this transaction. All parties involved in a psychotherapeutic endeavor want the effort to be successful and worthwhile.
258 Basic Techniques for Clinicians—Intervention
Patients want to relieve symptoms and find ways to improve their emotional
and behavioral health. Clinicians want to help others by sharing the knowledge
and technology of psychotherapy. Insurers and third-party payers want a quality service provided at lowest possible cost. Employers want their benefit programs to enhance the stability and productivity of their employees. Significant
others of the patient want relief from their worries and concerns as well as improvement in the patient’s personal functioning. To satisfy these many vested
interests, clinicians must translate the conceptualization into a treatment plan
that will focus on relevant, measurable goals and objectives.
A detailed conceptualization is an important foundation of the treatment
plan, but there are also other components. Clinicians must develop an effective
working relationship with their patients that engages them in their own internal process of psychological change. Rather than simply deciding what must be
done to the patient, psychotherapy clinicians must work with the patient to
forge an agreement concerning the goals and tasks of treatment (Bordin, 1979).
Sufficient intellectual skill and cognitive effort are necessary parts of a treatment process, but interpersonal, emotional, and behavioral skills also are essential to shape those goals into an experience that is deemed worthwhile to all
relevant parties.
Roles of Patient and Therapist
Because the traditional framework of psychotherapy was built on a medical
model, the role of the therapist began as one of a prescriptive expert who selected interventions and applied them to a receptive patient. The patient’s role
within this medical formulary was to be compliant with procedures and dutiful
in following recommendations. The typical clinician was an educated white
male, further reinforcing the broader gender and social stereotype of a dominant authority figure. Only recently has this profile of the provider population
begun to include a representative diversity. Although vestiges of this paternalistic prototype remain, therapeutic roles have shifted toward an egalitarian and
collaborative relationship (e.g., A. T. Beck et al., 2004; A. T. Beck, Rush, Shaw,
& Emery, 1979). In a collaborative partnership, both parties have an active role
in sharing information and developing an overall plan. Collaborative treatment
planning is based on direct and explicit communication about specific problems, goals, techniques, expectations, and informed consent. The therapist’s
role is to guide the process and protect the patient’s best interests. Part of the
therapist’s responsibility is to create and maintain a formal record that is accessible to the patient and available at the patient’s request to inform other
providers who might be involved in the patient’s care.
Many factors that have helped shape this paradigm shift away from an authoritarian power structure toward a more communicating partnership. One
factor is that the general public is more informed about biopsychosocial
processes and treatments, and thus expects a more informed discussion as part
of their experience. Another factor is that consumers have been empowered by
Developing a Treatment Plan 259
laws that stipulate their rights for accessing and controlling private health
care information. In addition, the increasing demand for accessible and costeffective treatment has vastly influenced the need to actively engage the patient as rapidly as possible. Can you think of any other reasons the roles of
patient and therapist have shifted? In what ways do you think that the
provider-patient relationship has retained a hierarchical power structure?
Importance of Collaboration Skills
Being able to engage patients in working together productively (the “working
alliance”) and maintaining a collaborative focus throughout treatment are fundamental to successful therapy. Evidence from the past several decades of psychotherapy research consistently supports the importance of these basic
ingredients. Approximately 30% of the variance in patient outcome in psychotherapy can be accounted for by relationship factors that are common
across different types or techniques of therapy (Lambert & Barley, 2002;
Wampold, 2001). The common factors in psychotherapy, as defined by Frank
and Frank (1991, p. 30), are (a) an emotionally charged, confiding relationship
with a helping person; (b) a healing setting; (c) a conceptualization; and (d) a
set of procedures based on the conceptualization that requires active participation of patient and therapist.
As this definition of common factors shows, the theoretical conceptualization and associated procedures are fundamental aspects of therapy, yet there is
also a context of active participation in a healing enterprise. The interactions
between patient and therapist, and their respective cognitive and emotional reactions to these exchanges are typically referred to as the process component of
therapy. In a review of over 2,300 empirical studies, Orlinsky, Grawe, and Parks
(1994) concluded that patient participation is the single most important element of therapy process and has the greatest single impact on the eventual outcome. Patients will participate more effectively when therapists fully set the
stage with specific techniques in the context of an encouraging, positive relationship. Intervention techniques such as exposure or cognitive restructuring
are important, but their impact can be enhanced, diminished, neutralized, or
otherwise altered by the interpersonal and emotional relationship between patient and therapist. Similarly, the results that may be achieved through strategic
use of specific techniques can reinforce a basically positive therapeutic alliance
with confidence, hope, and mastery. Thus, technical strategies and relationship
factors are interdependent parts in a single psychotherapy process (Safran, McMain, Crocker, & Murray, 1990; Safran & Segal, 1990).
The ability to establish and maintain collaboration with the patient is perhaps best considered as a set of skills that therapists develop and refine through
training and experience. Although therapy interactions are complex and multifaceted, research has spotlighted key features and skills of effective therapists.
As we might expect, therapists who are viewed by their patients as helpful interact in a positive manner, show interest, attempt to make patients feel comfortable, offer encouragement and reassurance, instill hope, show sensitivity to
patient feelings, and focus on practical assistance in problem solving and coping
260 Basic Techniques for Clinicians—Intervention
(Maluccio, 1979; McLeod, 1990). Cognitive-behavioral therapists tend to be
more active and directive than therapists of other orientations, but they also
communicate more support via encouragement, recognition of patient effort
and progress, and reinforcing statements (Keijers, Schaap, & Hoogduin, 2000).
Empathy, warmth, and genuineness, some of the earliest factors identified
as key to an effective therapeutic encounter, are just as relevant in cognitivebehavioral treatments (Beutler, Machado, & Allstetter Neufeldt, 1994; Keijers
et al., 2000). Empathy may be communicated by acknowledgment or inquiry
about the patient’s emotions, along with statements that reflect acceptance or
understanding of those emotions, without criticism or judgment. Behaviors
that communicate genuineness include being consistent, nondefensive, relaxed, honest, and interested (Egan, 1998). Warmth may be conveyed through
respectful actions and statements, encouragement, and recognition of client effort and progress (Serran, Fernandez, Marshall, & Mann, 2003).
Acquiring Core Skills of Collaboration
It is relatively easy to identify positive interpersonal qualities that characterize
an effective therapist. But ask yourself these questions: Do you think that these
qualities can be taught or acquired? Why does the therapist care about his or
her patients? How was this capacity acquired or learned? What does it take to
become confident as a therapist? Can this be learned? What about being coherent in one’s approach to therapy? Is there a manual that discriminates therapist
coherence from incoherence?
Typically, the developmental trajectory of a psychotherapist is long and demanding emotionally, physically, and financially. Therapists accumulate hundreds of hours of supervised experience over several years prior to independent
work. To attain the privilege of offering services to the general public, clinicians
must acquire sufficient knowledge and self-control and become acculturated to
professional standards. During the course of training, one learns to recognize
and productively direct the dynamic emotional components of psychotherapy,
including the thread of his or her own affective contributions. Emotional experiences of novice therapists often include anxious arousal (feeling tense or
guarded; freezing), uncertainty (“I’m not sure what to do,”), self-doubt (“I’m
probably doing this wrong,”), and a search for a sense of competence (“I wonder
what my strengths really are”).
The tasks of collaboration can loom large for novice clinicians. First, they
have to elicit trust and confidence from a virtual stranger. Then they have to
decide which interventions might be relevant for a particular patient, and skillfully apply them in a context of emotional arousal. If that isn’t difficult
enough, these unpolished efforts then have to be presented to an authority, the
supervisor, who will observe and formally evaluate the quality and effectiveness of the interaction and plan. Often apprenticing therapists receive a formal
academic grade for their performance of this challenging work. The demands of
this learning process can directly conflict with the expression of empathy,
warmth, genuineness, and the productive emotional connection that maximizes patient participation.
Developing a Treatment Plan 261
Over the course of embracing this challenge, core collaboration skills are
forged, and together with core technical skills, are woven into an overall competence and effectiveness. These skills are conceptualized as caring, coherence,
and confidence.
Caring
Literally hundreds of empirical studies support the conclusion that emotional
involvement and caring on the part of the therapist is a crucial ingredient to
successful therapy (Horvath & Symonds, 1991; D. J. Martin, Garske, & Davis,
2000; Orlinsky et al., 1994; Safran & Muran, 1995). Even in structured treatments (e.g., in vivo exposure, behavioral marital therapy), or those applied to
specific problems (problem drinking; sex offenses), patients who view their
therapist as warm and empathetic are more involved in their treatment and ultimately have a better outcome (e.g., Holtzworth-Munroe, Jacobson, DeKlyen,
& Whisman, 1989; Miller, Taylor, & West, 1980; Serran et al., 2003).
A great deal of the emotional charge to the therapy relationship is activated or deactivated, by the patient’s belief that the therapist cares. The therapist must find effective ways to establish this vital link in the working alliance.
There is no universal operational definition of caring, so we must rely on basic
strategies and be mindful whether our patients have received the intended message. Further, we must attend to our own emotional state, and be alert to any
factors that diminish the care that is intended, felt, and communicated to the
patient.
Some basic strategies for establishing and communicating a sense of caring
include treating the patient with respect as a person, responding directly and
promptly to patient inquiries and requests, asking for feedback, anticipating
possible difficulties or inconveniences, and allocating sufficient attention and
energy toward the patient (Wright & Davis, 1994). Therapists who show interest, offer encouragement and reassurance, instill hope, and offer practical assistance for increasing problem solving and coping are seen by their patients as
being most helpful (McLeod, 1990).
The notion of treating the patient with respect as a person is a broad concept, and readers are encouraged to explore varied contexts for interpreting
what this means to people from different cultures and walks of life. Greeting
the patient at the appointed time with a friendly remark and including a formal address at the first meeting can establish basic respect and caring for the
person’s dignity (e.g., “Good morning, Mr. Jones. Are you ready to come into
my office now?”). Providing a comfortable environment for meeting that is
both private and free from distractions also demonstrates respect. Unexpected
intrusions, distractions, or delays should be discussed in such a way as to
apologize for any inconvenience to the patient, and an attempt should be
made to protect the planned meeting. Similarly, presenting oneself as attentive, well rested, and focused on the patient’s concerns demonstrates caring
and respect for the trust given to you. In more traditional or psychodynamic
orientations, this might be referred to as the therapeutic “frame” and is attended to quite scrupulously.
262 Basic Techniques for Clinicians—Intervention
Behaviors that may deactivate the patient’s belief that the therapist cares
include overstructuring therapy, inappropriate self-disclosures, rigid use of
transference interpretation, inappropriate use of silence, criticism, hostile tone
or content, personal tension or distraction (Ackerman & Hilsenroth, 2001), or
confrontational approaches (Marshall et al., 2002). Confrontational approaches
that include aggressive criticism and sarcasm are thought to be especially
harmful to clients who have low self-esteem or are at the precontemplation
stage of change (Serran et al., 2003). The patient who experiences the therapist
as confrontational is likely to discredit or challenge the therapist, dismiss or devalue the issues, or agree on the surface but actually fail to participate (Cormier
& Cormier, 1991).
How therapists personally develop internal feelings of caring for the patient, or fail to experience caring, is certainly a complex question. From a therapist’s developmental perspective, we might predict that nascent skills require

Developing a Treatment Plan 263
a degree of self-preoccupation that could interfere with the experience and expression of caring. In general, therapists are most likely to be helpful when
happy and unhurried (Myers, 1996). However, the demands of clinical training
do not typically create a leisurely, feel-good experience.
It is difficult to be genuine or fully empathic with the experiences of
another when mental tensions or personal concerns are intruding on the therapist’s awareness. Questions of what to do next, how to implement a technique, whether one is measuring up to the model of the manual, concern for
the performance demands of supervision and evaluation, as well as general
personal concerns about career opportunities or stability (e.g., “Are there any
decent jobs left in applied practice?” or “Maybe I should just concentrate on
research or teaching”) are typical among novice clinicians. These concerns become part of the context in which the therapist perceives and thinks about the
patient. Novice therapists may care passionately about their patients, but they
also need to feel some internal stability in their self-confidence and selfdirection. They are most likely to feel a sense of caring for patients whom they
can understand and help. Patients who are quite different from themselves
are likely to be the most challenging. Patients with multiple problems, or
those who are slow to change will not offer the same level of self-satisfaction
that the therapist might hope for as reinforcement for the effort of caring. If
other system challenges such as paperwork overload or low pay provoke the
therapist to question his or her commitment to this professional role (“Is law
school still an option?”), this relative detachment might lead to a decrease in
the emotional intensity of caring.
Therapists who receive their clinical training in a program with strong
research emphasis may be especially vulnerable to a double bind in caring
about their patients. Their emotional involvement with applied clinical practice may be treated, overtly or covertly, as an impediment to the priority of research productivity. They may feel guilty for the time involved in clinical
work, disloyal to their advisors or faculty when gaining satisfaction from
working with patients, and perhaps fearful that clinical involvement will significantly compromise their research progress. Moreover, there may be internal personal conflict about their professional identity as they consider career
plans and options. They may be gratified by the emotional experience of caring, yet reluctant to openly admit these feelings. They may fear the disapproval of academic mentors or feel alienated from their own internalized
ideals of becoming an academic psychologist. Anticipating this potential bind,
the training program can endeavor to validate the emotional experience of
the trainees, support the importance of caring and role of the clinical therapist, and encourage opportunities for integrating research and practice
throughout the training program.
Taken together, these factors illustrate why burnout is a notable risk
for novice psychologists. Such therapists have less experience, fewer wellestablished skills but high demand work roles, and are more apt to have role
conflict and role ambiguity. Caregiver burnout can occur at any career stage,
and may also be a notable risk in middle to late career if skills have eroded, or
personal stressors significantly interfere with work focus. The issue of burnout
across the career is discussed further in Chapter 15.
264 Basic Techniques for Clinicians—Intervention
Coherence
The treatment plan must be presented in a way that is coherent to the patient,
and consistent with the problem conceptualization. Patients are apt to lose
trust in the therapy or in the therapist if the rationale for intervention is unclear or if the proposed techniques do not make sense, based on the patient’s
personal theory of problem origin.
If a therapist offers vague, stereotyped, or overly intellectualized recommendations, if they switch techniques abruptly or fail to provide a rationale, or
if they are insensitive to the patient’s cultural worldview, patients can lose
hope and think of their therapist as incompetent or uncaring. Both underexplaining and overexplaining are risks to treatment coherence. Patients who
switch from one therapist to another, perhaps seeking a different “brand” of
therapy, may do this because there is no coherent plan to the therapy.
Clinical Example 3
Ellen, a 38-year-old mother and health
care professional sought therapy for
anxiety, panic attacks, and phobias. She
explained that she had been in supportive therapy for over 2 years, and although her therapist was very pleasant
and sensitive as a listener, the therapy
seemed to lack direction or purpose.
Ellen wanted to learn ways to overcome her phobias and panic attacks, but
did not see how her current therapy,
which consisted of repetitive discussions of her childhood and her relationships with her parents, was helping her
to accomplish these objectives. The
connection between these discussions
about her past relationships and her
current symptoms was fuzzy and inconsistent with her worries about having a chemical imbalance or physical
disease.
Ellen’s therapist acknowledged
the previous therapist’s efforts as a
relationship-focused approach that
is helpful in some instances of anxiety
disorder. She then offered a brief
rationale for an alternative approach
focusing on thoughts, feelings, and
beliefs associated with different body
sensations, particularly unexpected
sensations. By not directly criticizing
or discrediting the previous therapy,
Ellen’s new therapist fostered continuing confidence in treatment in general
and provided an acceptable rationale
for Ellen to discriminate past from current experience. Further, the therapist
engendered a coping model by acknowledging that it made sense to try
the former approach, but given Ellen’s
view of her problems, it also made
sense to try different tactics.
Confidence
Confidence is important for both therapist and patient, but it is not very effective to simply demand or expect confidence in yourself, or from your patients.
Rather than coaxing with a directive to “have confidence,” it may be more productive to review the ways that you can increase (or decrease) confidence in
the therapy process, in your therapy skills, and in the application of specific
skills with specific people.
First, therapists who hold positive beliefs about the value of therapy in
general, and about the potential usefulness of specific techniques will be more
Developing a Treatment Plan 265
likely to communicate this confidence to the patient. For general confidence, it
may be helpful to recall that a substantial body of empirical research across different forms of psychotherapy has shown that approximately 80% of those
treated will realize positive effects (Wampold, 2001). For specific techniques,
the number of studies demonstrating positive effects with different disorders
grows every year, and can quickly be accessed with a directed literature search.
Continuing education in its various forms can help therapists stay up to date on
the latest empirical findings that support specific techniques and interventions,
and thus boost their confidence in making recommendations and encouraging
the patient to look for potential benefit in the treatment.
Confidence in individual therapy skills and specific technical skills with different disorders is typically acquired through accumulated experience, evidence
from the outcomes of that experience, formal evaluations, informal feedback and
observing the work of others. For beginning therapists, or those unfamiliar with
a particular disorder, this discovery process begins with the first patient, where
feedback from the patient and his or her clinical response, as well as selfobservation and supervision guide the systematic building of assurance and belief
in both technique and ability. Errors are recognized and corrective actions taken.
Some degree of confidence is built on learning the hard way what not to do.
With further experience comes the ability to recognize limits and to communicate appropriate reservations and consideration of alternatives without
undue doubt or hesitation. Therapists who communicate a “coping” perspective
(e.g., “We can work together systematically to see what works and what
doesn’t”) engender a stronger bond and more effective results than those who
project a “mastery” perspective (e.g., “I have to come up with the answers to
fix your problems”; Kassinove & Tafrate, 2002; Mahoney & Norcross, 1993).
Thus, the confident therapist is apt to hold the following beliefs: “Therapy is
generally worthwhile and useful if conducted in a professional manner”; “Specific techniques tested with similar patients may be beneficial to this patient”;
and most importantly, “I am capable of working with this patient to apply these
techniques in the interest of his or her personal goals; the evidence will help us
decide what works best for this individual.”
These beliefs, or similar ones, will help the therapist achieve a paramount objective, which is to help the patient comprehend and test the conceptualization as an authentic explanation for their problems, or means for
achieving their goals. This builds the patient’s confidence in both the therapist
and the activities that the two will undertake in service of the patient’s objectives. Patient confidence is apt to have a reinforcing effect on the therapist,
who will then more confidently encourage the patient to undertake the specific tasks of therapy.
It is not unusual for patients to have doubts about therapy, particularly as it
may apply to their particular problems. Gentle suggestion is often sufficient
to encourage the patient to “give this approach a fair try.” The structured
cognitive-behavioral approach is helpful in this regard, as there are typically
points of evaluation and feedback both during sessions, and across the course of
treatment. Some patients will be much more skeptical, however, and may repeatedly demand to know what the therapy is going to do for them. At the points of
pressure, it is crucial that therapists not allow this challenge and the subsequent
266 Basic Techniques for Clinicians—Intervention
arousal it may provoke to puncture their confidence. The confident therapist will
most likely encourage persistence and focus on the treatment strategies.
This persistence under pressure of doubt and demand from the patient
both emanates from and reinforces a more general confidence in structured
treatment, and one’s ability to conduct that treatment. At times of challenge,
the therapist can also amplify efforts to demonstrate caring, and to maintain a
clear and coherent rationale for treatment. A confident therapist will reflect on
the clinical implications of the patient’s doubts and demands for certainty and
use this information to sharpen the problem conceptualization.
Clinical Example 4
Melody, a psychology intern, reported
to her supervisor that she was feeling
increasingly anxious and depressed
about her rotation in the mental health
center family services. She had even experienced a few panic attacks, although
these occurred on weekends, times
when she hoped to be relaxing but instead worried about her clinical caseload and client progress, or lack thereof.
Melody’s graduate training had emphasized critical thinking skills and she
was well versed in pinpointing empirical
weaknesses or flaws in the existing literature. On her internship, however, she
felt overwhelmed by the demands of
conceptualizing cases and developing
treatment plans. She was often flooded
with negative thoughts about the limitations of various forms of therapy. Before
and after sessions, she might think,
“There’s no way I can make a difference
with this family.” During staff meetings
when cases were assigned, she would try
to avoid accepting new clients because
most of them had problems for which
there is no tested protocol. Her clients
typically had numerous problems, only
some of which could be addressed with
standard manualized therapy. Melody
had very little confidence in the potential benefit of her efforts, in part because
her attention was highly focused on
treatment limitations, and she was easily
discouraged by complicating variables.
Melody agreed to develop more of a
coping perspective in her work, and
with her supervisor’s guidance, focus
on increasing her basic collaborative
skills. Rather than trying to fit patients
into a prototype, she planned to work
with each client on targeting a specific
list of problems, and then to apply different treatment strategies with those
problems one at a time. Together she
and her supervisor worked out a plan
for Melody to respond to her “empirical
critic” thoughts with encouraging alternatives (e.g., “I have some ideas to try
in this session and can test how they
work”; “I’m sure I can find one idea that
may be helpful to offer to this client today”; “There is no definite reason to believe that therapy can’t help this person,
especially if it is based on empirically
supported models and makes good use
of the common ingredients”).
Sometimes therapists undermine their own confidence through the distortion of “idealizing the masters.” This occurs when the therapist comes to believe
that others, perhaps those who have lectured or shared positive clinical examples in a public forum, are especially gifted in ways that they are not. When confronted with a difficult clinical situation, therapists may attribute fault to some
internal inadequacy and harbor the belief that the clinical master would have no
Developing a Treatment Plan 267
difficulty in such a predicament. Thus, therapists may systematically engage in a
judgment of their personal efforts as inferior compared with the imagined efforts of a master, slowing down their own effective problem solving and weakening their self-confidence. Like doubts about the therapy process, a coping
perspective is needed for confidence to build. It may also be important to consider the alternative notion that clinical challenges are difficult for everyone,
even highly experienced clinicians. Therapists must allow themselves to have
confidence of effort, even though they may not feel like an expert.
Goals and Tasks of Treatment
The cornerstones of a treatment plan are the goals and tasks that patient and
therapist select. Treatment goals, quite simply, are the changes that the patient
hopes to realize. Through the processes of assessment and conceptualization,
the therapist helps the patient shape an operational definition of the goals in
terms of something that is observable, measurable, and can be increased or decreased. Therapists may propose additional goals for the patient’s consideration,
based on their professional judgment of what may be in the patient’s best interest, with an emphasis on supporting the greatest degree of patient autonomy.
The tasks of treatment are the strategies that will be used to achieve the
goals. These are the strategies and techniques that the therapist will offer and
explain, and that the patient will either accept or decline. From the list of
changes desired by the patient, the therapist will outline a corresponding list of
tools and strategies, and will help the patient apply these interventions and
evaluate the impact. Agreement between patient and therapist on these goals
and tasks is crucial to the success of treatment, and as noted, lack of agreement
will decrease the patient’s participation and undermine the positive emotional
charge of the therapy.
Translating Chief Complaints into Measurable Goals
Beginning at intake interview, the patient cites problems, symptoms, and reasons
for seeking therapy. The provider then attempts to discover what the client hopes
to gain from therapy, and what results are desired. Often, the patient’s response
is framed in terms of cessation of the symptom or complaint (e.g., to “stop procrastinating”). Sometimes the patient’s stated objective is vague and global, as in
“get my old self back,” or “get my head together,” or “to be a happier person.”
Occasionally, the patient may have no goal for therapy other than
to show up. Someone else may think that the patient should be in therapy, so
the goal is to make that other person happy or to get out of trouble by going
to therapy. The patient may show up with the mistaken belief that going to
therapy and complaining about others will somehow change those people.
Sometimes, therapy is sought for self-enhancement, motivated by curiosity
about one’s psychological functioning, or perhaps motivated by an attempt to
cultivate social status through an accumulation of relationships with supposedly stylish service providers.
268 Basic Techniques for Clinicians—Intervention
In every instance, it is important to specify treatment goals in operational
terms. This will focus the treatment on a purpose and ensure agreement between patient and therapist for the intended aims. One type of operational goal
might be the reduction of a specific symptom or set of symptoms (e.g., panic attacks less than once per month; depressed mood reduced to mild range or less
on symptom index). Another type of operational goal might be achievement of
a specific task or set of tasks (e.g., fly cross-country on a commercial flight; attend family functions, become more socially active with friends).
Operational goals can also incorporate broader emotional experiences such
as achieving more satisfaction in marriage or living a more peaceful, joyful, and
less worried day-to-day life, or functioning better in a particular role (e.g., being
an effective parent). The details of an operational definition for a broader goal
would typically have specific behavioral reference points with meaning and relevance to the patient. These reference points may not be known at the beginning
of therapy, for the task of therapy is to explore and define the behavioral targets.
For one patient, a joyful life might be having time to exercise and plant flowers.
For another, a joyful life might be found in more challenging work and greater
self-discipline. For yet another patient, joy might be discovered by learning how
to defuse the mental process of worry and accept a range of emotions in daily living. Similarly, the goal of being a better parent is anchored in meaning and relevance to the patient, in the context of the particular challenges being addressed.
For one parent, this might mean increasing the number of positive and nondisciplinary interactions. For another, it might mean tolerating some conflict in the
interest of applying more consistent limits and age-appropriate demands.
Agreements and Contracts
It is important to begin formulating a direction and plan for therapy from the
initial contact. A preliminary formulation might be offered in the first meeting,
with the provision that this plan will be updated as more information is gathered and progress is made. It is also useful to establish a written summary of
the initial treatment plan, both to facilitate the agreement of both (or all) parties, and to keep a record of the intended aims of the work.
Therapists may differ in whether they have the patient sign a written treatment plan, or rely primarily on verbal collaboration and keep a written record
for their own purposes. Some believe that formal contracting enhances motivation and adherence with treatment procedures, as well as provides a reminder to
the patient about treatment options and contingencies that may be forgotten
over time or under stress (Otto, Reilly-Harrington, Kogan, & Winett, 2003).
Others find that the verbal agreement is sufficient and appropriate, especially
with patients who present in the early stages of change (see Chapter 12). The
patient’s state of readiness for change has a big impact on how the treatment
plan is perceived. Reluctant or uncertain patients who are tentative about therapy and just beginning to think about change may react negatively to contracts
and consent forms. Asking them to sign a written treatment plan could strain
the working alliance beyond a critical tipping point and cause a retreat from
therapy. Verbal agreement to try a limited treatment plan may offer a better way
to engage the uncertain patient. If the patient is fully committed to change and
Developing a Treatment Plan 269
ready to begin planning action, the patient’s homework might include writing
parts of a treatment plan. This encourages patients to function as their own
therapist, with the professional providing consultation. We prefer to keep in
mind the heuristic of treating patients, not pieces of paper, and remain flexible
in how we formally organize the plan for treatment.
An example of a comprehensive treatment plan is illustrated in Box 10.1.
Client assets and potential obstacles to motivation are included, along with a
list of problems and general strategies to use in addressing those problems. The
addition of a specified time frame is helpful for sketching a target for completion, although this may not be clear in every instance.
As noted, having the patient review and sign the document is optional. The
therapist may still use the same or similar written format for record-keeping
purposes, but present the ideas verbally to confirm the patient’s agreement and
collaboration. In either case, the treatment plan is discussed, and the patient’s
informed consent obtained. This discussion is noted in the progress record, including reference to a review of the risks, potential benefits, alternatives, and
any pertinent concerns of the patient. It may be appropriate to expand, or update this plan as more information is gathered, the patient progresses in readiness for change, or as initial problems recede and new problems emerge.
Clinical Example 5
David, a 33-year-old business professional came to therapy because of longstanding mild to moderate depression.
His problem list included loneliness,
procrastination, and anxiety about his
work performance. In his initial interviews, it was also noted that he often
coped with stress by drinking alcohol,
sometimes more than 5 drinks in one
episode. However, he was conscious
of his health, was of normal weight,
maintained an exercise program of
running and biking, and had always
been a nonsmoker. His most recent
physical checkup was 4 months prior,
and he was evaluated as free from any
major health problems other than depression. When asked about his goals
for therapy, he stated that he wanted to
“be in control of my life and get over
this depression.”
David’s therapist summarized the
assets that might facilitate his progress
as his good physical health, stable employment with adequate health care
benefits, and his motivation to engage
in a process of self-change. The challenges that might interfere with progress or prolong treatment included his
long-standing social isolation (no family nearby, few social contacts, no
friends in the area), his tendency to
cope with stress by drinking, often
alone, his prolonged work hours, and
the persistent duration of his depression. They agreed to the general goals
of increasing his sense of control over
his work life, his social life, and his
mood. The provider explained that
they would focus on understanding
and altering the learned response patterns, that is the thoughts, beliefs, actions, and feelings that were associated
with each of these problem areas.

Selecting the Initial Problem for Intervention
After setting out the general direction of therapy, the next logical question is
“What is the best place to begin with the list of problems?” Several considerations will help focus this important step. The first consideration is the relative
level of the patient’s overall functional impairment and degree of activation.
For those who are more severely impaired and functioning poorly in basic role
expectations, it is important to initially focus on remediation of functional
deficits in activity level. First, patients often find it easier to grasp the idea of
taking a specific action as a place to start, in favor of the more abstract task of
working with thoughts and beliefs. Second, it may relieve the patient’s anxiety
somewhat to have a concrete plan to do something, as this supports feelings of
control, empowerment, and hope. Third, changes in behavior, even small ones,
often precipitate a ripple effect on functioning overall, bringing a large measure
of relief relative to the effort expended.
There are two other significant considerations in picking initial target
problems. One is the importance of the problem for the patient’s self-esteem
and personal responsibility, and the other is the urgency or potential risk of the
problem. Any problem that is potentially life-threatening should be addressed
immediately and sufficiently. Beyond life threat, any problem that is apt to develop into a crisis and could put someone else at risk, or significantly harm the
patient’s stability would be a definite priority. If a depressed mother reports
spending her day in bed while her children “sleep,” watch television, or “play
on their own,” her level of interaction with the children and childcare support
need to be addressed immediately.
With this in mind, it is also important to rapidly address the primary issues
that the patient wants to address in therapy, the chief concerns that precipitated
the decision to seek service. Many times, the area of crisis is the problem of greatest risk, and both patient and therapist agree on the priority of treatment. If there
is disagreement, there may be a way to acknowledge the patient’s priorities while
focusing on a key neglected issue. If the depressed mother presents her biggest
concern as her weight and she acknowledges the parenting issue only peripherally,
it may be possible to link the two problems to a similar initial intervention. She
could be offered the option of working on both problems at the same time through
behavioral activation, perhaps by taking the children to an indoor or outdoor playground. Without criticism, the therapist must bring the patient’s attention to the
neglected problem and activate a process of considering change. Therapists must
also know the boundaries of neglect or endangerment that would precipitate some
further directive action such as involving child protective services.
Clinical Example 6
Let’s return to the discussion of David,
the depressed businessman. Once the
general goals of therapy were agreed
on, David’s therapist asked him to describe the elements of each problem
area that he wished to better control,
to develop a clearer, more operational
view of the nondepressed life he wished

Building and Maintaining the Therapeutic Relationship
The therapist’s opportunity to build and maintain a relationship with the patient begins with the very first contact, often over the telephone, and continues
throughout the duration of active contact. Each interaction represents another
chance to construct and extend a positive relationship by attending carefully to
the interaction. Even the best plans for treatment are worth little if there is not
a sufficiently positive therapeutic relationship to support the patient’s involvement in the treatment. As noted by Carkhuff (2000), the tools of observing and
listening are essential to the relationship process. It is difficult if not impossible
to build a positive therapeutic relationship without a strong foundation of basic
active listening skills.
A collaborative relationship is built not only through keen observation,
but also by providing a caring and thoughtful response to what has been seen
and heard. The therapist does not just passively absorb all the patient’s complaints, as nontherapists sometimes imagine when they wonder how someone
can sit and listen to problems all day long. Instead, the therapist is actively focusing attention and processing information at multiple levels to both synthesize information and foster a positive, friendly interpersonal exchange. The
following techniques can be used as a framework for general relationship
building within therapy. Not surprisingly, these techniques also work well in
developing relationships across many other contexts.
Clinical Example 6 (Continued)
to achieve. At first, he responded with
more global answers to the therapist’s
inquiries. For example, when asked
what he wanted to better control at
work, he stated that he wanted to “get
things done when they should be done.”
From this, the therapist gently persisted
in obtaining further detail that would
pinpoint a more specific and measurable target by asking what particular
things David needed to be getting done
now that had been put off.
With this directed questioning, David
listed some specific tasks at work such
as his quarterly budget reports, his purchasing requests, some written correspondence, and meetings he needed to
schedule. The therapist then introduced
the techniques of graded tasks to help
him initiate changes in his behavior,
and guided discovery to explore potential thoughts or circumstances interfering with execution of these desired
tasks. Feedback from David was requested, to check his understanding,
motivation, and involvement in the
agreed tasks, as well as to elicit any further interfering thoughts or possible
negative reactions to the therapist or the
therapeutic exchange.
David felt a large measure of relief
from scheduling a few specific tasks
that he had avoided and neglected, thus
improving his work performance. Work
problems were addressed first as this
was central to his self-esteem, identity,
and overall stability. Poor work performance, missed deadlines, or a bad work
review would likely have a serious
destabilizing impact overall, and thus
presented a greater risk relative to his
other ongoing problems.
Developing a Treatment Plan 273
Softly Focus Attention on the Patient
Deliberately and mindfully focusing on the patient directs energy toward the
therapeutic relationship. For most people, this is a pleasant and perhaps rare experience. This focused attention should be soft and friendly, not harsh or judgmental. Kindly and patiently taking in as many details of the patient’s
presentation as possible, both verbal and nonverbal, communicates a message of
accepting and valuing the patient as an individual. However, the therapist’s pace,
tone, and nonverbal body language should avoid extremes of intensity and be responsive to the patient’s nonverbal cues. Staring at the patient, scowling, or gathering information in an interrogating manner can foil the positive relationship,
as can being too soft or diminutive. Keen observations of the patient’s posture,
facial expressions, tone of voice, dress and grooming, and flow of conversation
can provide important clues to the emotional content of communications. These
observations support the accuracy of the conceptualization, which is vital to validating the patient’s feelings and allowing them to feel understood.
Resist Distractions
It is difficult to build a relationship when you are only partially present in the
interaction. Although distractions are inevitable, you can make efforts to reduce, prevent, and resist the division of your attention while in the presence of
your patient. All conversations with others besides the patient should stop, including covert conversations with yourself or others about unrelated matters.
It is important to note your internal reactions and hypotheses while talking with the patient, but the focus of the provider’s attention is still with the
patient. Problems in being distracted by nonpatient concerns may be a function
of a temporary state (e.g., fatigue or illness), and may be dealt with coping tools
appropriate to the distraction. For example, you might take medication to alleviate symptoms of an illness or make it a point to be sufficiently rested before
work. For most distractions, an appropriate coping remedy can be tried. If the
distraction cannot be delayed for the duration of the session, that is a good indication of a need to cancel or reschedule the meeting.
If the distraction seems to be triggered by contact with the patient, a conceptual review of the interaction and emotional reactions is warranted, perhaps with clinical consultation. The distraction is not due to a circumstance of
the therapist (e.g., “I need to be home with my sick child”), but rather is a function of something happening in the therapy (e.g., “the client is being tangential
again and I’m getting bored and irritated”). If the therapist ignores or indulges
the distraction by letting attention wander away from the patient for extended
segments of time, the patient may detect this break in connection and respond
with corresponding emotional detachment.
Recall Information about the Patient
The more that the therapist can remember about the details of the patient’s world
and life experience, the more the patient will feel known, understood, and hopefully accepted by the therapist. The feeling of closeness and trust begins when the
274 Basic Techniques for Clinicians—Intervention
patient first shares details of self. This bond of trust grows much stronger when
the therapist demonstrates having retained an actual memory of this information.
Recall of family members’ names, critical events, or important relationships all
suggest a degree of attention and emotional involvement associated with a personal relationship with the inference that the therapist cares about the patient.
Disclosure of information about oneself can enhance a therapeutic bond,
but this must be done carefully in the service of the therapeutic objectives. Judicious sharing of selected personal information can contribute to identification and feelings of trust in the best circumstances. However, significant clinical
and ethical implications must be considered to ensure that the patient’s best interests remain the focus and harm does not occur (Barnett, 1998).
A therapist might disclose to Mrs. Green that like her, she also has two sisters, and this enhances their bond because of a sense of shared experience. Mrs.
Green now believes that she and her therapist share something in common, and
her therapist understands her unique experiences. However, if Mrs. Green was
always the caretaker of her two younger siblings, it may not be useful for her to
know that the therapist was the youngest in her sibling group. Now Mrs. Green
begins to project the image of “little sister” onto her therapist, and directs her attention to unnecessary and unhelpful caretaking actions. She worries if the therapist is comfortable, happy, or eating enough. If not watchful, the therapist may
progress down the slippery slope and allow valuable therapy time to be diverted
toward the therapist’s personal needs and concerns. Mrs. Green’s therapist might
be more effective in building a strong relationship bond through her efforts to remember details about the adventures and travails of Mrs. Green and her sisters.
Because of the potential implications of self-disclosure that can be difficult
for even the most experienced, beginning therapists are well-advised to use extreme caution. Although stiff attempts to maintain a shroud of secrecy around
one’s personal life are a misguided effort (Barnett, 1998), venting or proffering
too much information can impair rather than facilitate the therapy relationship.
Recognize and Control Judgmental Tendencies
An objective perspective is a crucial component of relationship building in therapy. We maintain this for both ethical and technical reasons. First, patients have a
right to expect the therapist to be a compassionate listener who will address their
concerns in a responsible and nonbiased manner. The professional role of therapist implies reserving personal judgment and focusing on the patient’s needs. Second, the patient will typically be more open and less resistant if the therapist
models the ability to weigh the problem without judging the person. The therapist’s emotional reactions to the problem can be viewed as a cue for how others in
the patient’s world might react, and perhaps how the patient feels about him- or
herself. For the sake of the relationship, the therapist exercises reserve and caution in sharing those feelings, and is alert to his or her own personal biases.
A therapist would not say to the patient, “Wow, you are extremely irritating to me. You seem to be an incredibly self-centered person.” Instead, the
therapist would use an emotional response as a guide for clinical exploration,
in the interest of therapeutic contemplation of the problem. So the therapist
might ask, “Do your friends or family ever seem to be exasperated or shorttempered with you? Let’s talk about some of the possible triggers for that.”
Developing a Treatment Plan 275
In situations where the patient “pushes the therapist’s buttons,” the therapist’s personal emotional reactions threaten to distort the clinical relationship.
From an objective perspective, the patient is not doing anything that others
would find particularly irritating. Rather, it is the therapist’s sensitivity and
judgment of the patient or the patient’s problem that is triggering the feelings of
irritation, perhaps because of a personal bias or a stereotype. A therapist who
has difficulty managing judgmental tendencies has a range of options, including supervision, consultation, or transfer of the patient. Ask yourself which
types of patients or problems might challenge your own emotional and judgmental reserve? How could you address these challenges?
Elicit Input and Feedback
A contemporary collaboration includes an active exchange of information and
shared decision making. Although the therapist is responsible for structuring
both individual sessions and the therapy as a whole, this objective can only be
achieved with active input and feedback from the patient. Patients are empowered to select problems and priorities and to set the pace of change. Patient feedback is directly solicited so that the provider can discern the most personally
meaningful elements of the intervention. This important process of negotiation
between patient and therapist (Safran & Muran, 2000) is more than superficial
consensus; it is both a necessary condition and an intrinsic part of a change process. In this atmosphere of ongoing negotiation, it is more likely that misunderstandings or negative reactions can be pinpointed early and resolved, rather than
allowed to fester and possibly derail a potentially productive venture.
Sensitivity to the patient’s personal need for structure is particularly important to successful collaboration. A single type of session structure does not
fit all individuals and personalities. Some patients respond well to highly active
therapists who ensure that each session has a discrete beginning, middle, and
end. Others find it more productive when the session follows a more conversational flow that pinpoints key issues. Some patients are comfortable in setting
their own agenda; others need more socialization to their options within therapy. When the need for structure is a component of a broader clinical issue, as
in the case of someone with a dependent personality, the behavioral aspects of
structuring the session can be broken down systematically and approached as
important skills to be developed.
Problems in Collaboration
Some therapy relationships are relatively uncomplicated as patient and therapist take readily to their respective roles and a productive working alliance follows. Both parties have functional expectations that need little if any explicit
discussion. With other patients, more specific effort is needed because there are
particular problems in therapeutic collaboration. Passive noncollaboration and
avoidance are two types of problematic collaboration. Passive noncollaboration
may be distinguished from active avoidance by the underlying antecedents or
triggers for the response (Davis & Hollon, 1999). Passive noncollaboration may
stem from low expectations for success, but active avoidance suggests negative,
personalized meanings such as distrust of therapy or externalized blame.
276 Basic Techniques for Clinicians—Intervention
There are many possible reasons for noncollaborative responses, although
very few will actually reflect an internal motivation toward illness. These reasons can appear in any combination, and may vary according to changes in the
patient’s life circumstance as well as progress in therapy and response to the
therapist’s skill. Among the causes of patient noncollaboration are beliefs that
interfere with a good working relationship, such as the following commonly
encountered ideas:
• Being in therapy means I am a weak person.
• I don’t really trust therapists; my therapist has to prove he or she cares and
is an expert.
• If I make the changes the therapist suggests, I will become a selfish, uncaring person.
• If I make the changes the therapist suggests, I will be letting others down.
• If I make the changes the therapist suggests, I will be forced to do things I
cannot do.
• My therapist needs to know everything about me before I can change.
• My therapist should be able to know what is bothering me.
• My therapist should be able to fix me; feeling better should just happen.
• My therapist should force me to do things to make me better.
• I want to be my therapist’s favorite patient.
There are several ways that the therapist might assess the salience or influence of any or all these beliefs. One is to raise a discussion about the patient’s expectations and experience of therapy progress. Sometimes the patient will directly
disclose the belief, or express a feeling that with some gentle probing will allow
access to the belief. The following dialogue illustrates how this might occur:
T: How do you feel about your progress so far in overcoming your anxiety and
doing things that are difficult for you to do?
P: Frustrated. I want to be a lot further along.
T: What do you think has gotten in your way, or held you back?
P: Nothing really, but I think I need someone to force me to do what is difficult. I’m not very good at disciplining myself, and I need a demanding
taskmaster to make me do what I don’t want to do.
Obviously, further discussion of this belief and its implications, including the
long-term effects of depending on someone else for self-discipline, and possibly
experimenting with graded tasks will be an important part of the overall therapy, and therapy collaboration.
Another avenue for detecting therapy-interfering beliefs is in reviewing
homework assignments, especially the perceived benefit and perceived difficulty of doing the homework:
T: I’d like to hear about your homework, which if I remember correctly,
was to schedule an hour for doing something just for yourself that
Developing a Treatment Plan 277
you might enjoy. We discussed some ideas, as I recall. Were you able to
try out any of the things we considered, or did you try something completely different?
P: Well, I thought about the assignment a lot, but didn’t actually do anything.
T: That sounds like some important cognitive work. Can we talk further about
that?
P: Okay, but I don’t know what there is to talk about. I didn’t do anything.
T: That’s okay; what is important is to understand your thought process. Can
you tell me about your internal conversation about this idea? Was there
sort of a back-and-forth deliberation?
P: Yeah, there was. I really sort of wanted to do something just for me. The idea
sounded good, like something I never do. I even called and scheduled an
appointment at a nail salon to get a pedicure and was looking forward to a
nice treat. There is a coffee shop next to the salon, and I was going to get
one of those delicious caramel frappachinos and just relax and enjoy being
pampered for a little bit. But then I realized that I would be taking time
away from my family and spending money on myself, and I just didn’t feel
right about it. I guess I felt that taking time for me was going to turn me
into one of those selfish, uncaring, “high maintenance” types and I just
couldn’t do it. If I took that time for myself, I felt like I would be letting my
family down. So I spent the afternoon ironing clothes instead.
When the belief is revealed in the process of discussion, there is an immediate opportunity for further exploration and possible modification. Working
with the patient’s beliefs that her behavioral change will produce selfishness,
uncaring behavior, and negligence of responsibility to others is a prerequisite to
any sustained shift in her behavior. If the therapist had simply focused on trying
to prompt the behavior of scheduling pleasant activities and not explored the
therapy-interfering beliefs, some strain and tension probably would have been
introduced into the working alliance, and progress could stall or deteriorate.
Another useful way to detect therapy-interfering beliefs is by noting and
gently exploring behavior or affect within the context of therapy interaction.
When the patient shows an affective shift during a session, it is often useful not
only to inquire “what went through your mind just then,” but also to inquire,
“is there anything about what I have been doing or saying that might provoke
that feeling?” For example:
T: I noticed you winced just then, and seemed a bit agitated. Was there something that crossed your mind just then?
P: Actually, I was feeling irritated.
T: Was the irritation related to the topic we are discussing, or possibly something in my manner?
P: Well, I don’t like answering questions. I feel uncomfortable trying to put
my feelings into words. I wish you would just already know what is
bothering me.
Yet another way to consider possible interfering beliefs is to make an observation and present the belief as a hypothesis. If the patient talks a great deal
and has a difficult time setting an agenda, and seems to work hard to “get
everything out” by filling the therapist in on all the details of their life, the therapist might offer the following capsule summary.
T: I really appreciate your effort to be thorough in telling me how you are doing.
I want to ensure that we stay productively focused, but it’s a little hard to do
that and take everything in. I’d like to check out a possibility with you that
might help us be more efficient. Do you think that it is necessary for me to
know everything that has happened to fully understand and help you? Is
that maybe one reason why you work so hard to tell me everything?
P: Well, yes. I don’t really know what is important. So I need to get all the information to you so that you can figure out how to solve my problems.
T: So your assumption is that I need to know everything so that I can figure
out the solution to your problems.
P: Yes.
T: Is that strategy working very well so far?
P: Not really. I’m working really hard and I haven’t really gotten to hear what
you think I should do yet.
T: How about if we consider some different ideas about how to make our work
more productive?
This strategy of summarizing data from the patient in terms of observed
behaviors and reactions, and proposing an inferred belief can be a rapid way to
address collaborative problems. This method may be especially useful with beliefs that are difficult to elicit through a series of Socratic questions. However,
it may be wise to use this tool judiciously, as it can come across as heavyhanded, or may imply that the therapist knows what patients are thinking, and
in a sense, can “read their mind.”
Five Indications of a Good Working Relationship
How do you know if you have a good working relationship with your patient?
The provider’s personal perspective on this might suffer a self-serving bias.
We have a good working relationship, we think, because we intend to have a
good working relationship. Our patients might deem the working relationship
good for the very same reason. Virtuous intentions aside, what does a good
working relationship look like? Extensive and detailed empirical study of this
issue (see Horvath & Greenberg, 1994; Safran & Muran, 2000) has consistently identified a good working relationship as one that is characterized by
friendliness and a moderate, reciprocal degree of interpersonal control between patient and therapist.
Because the therapeutic relationship is an ongoing process, it is useful to
consider ways to self-monitor the current state of this working relationship. In
addition to assessment of the patient’s clinical progress (reduction in anxious
symptoms, progress toward specific goals), we can assess the following five indicators of overall friendliness and a balance of control:
1. There is a desire to have contact. A simple indication of the positive quality of
the working relationship is the overall motivation to have contact with this
278 Basic Techniques for Clinicians—Intervention
specific person. Even if progress is difficult, those in a friendly relationship
will want to meet, as the contact is perceived as pleasant and therefore interpersonally reinforcing. Understandably, the patient’s ambivalence about
contact, observed perhaps by lateness, cancellations, long lags between
meetings, general lack of anticipation of the meeting, or even anxious apprehension may be a function of hopelessness or low self-esteem.
The friendliness of the interaction may be just the single thin thread
that helps motivate the patient to reconnect even through these difficulties. If the therapist has difficulties in finding the motivation for contact
with a patient, perhaps observed by avoiding phone calls, negative anticipation of the scheduled meeting, a wish for the patient to cancel, or desire
for transfer or termination, this also indicates a threat to the quality of the
relationship. Conceptualization of the pertinent triggers for the contact
avoidance is needed, as well as possible consultation or supervision.
2. Information is shared. A good working relationship is a confiding experience,
where the patient discloses personal thoughts and feelings. The patient has
things to talk about, and is able to discuss emotionally laden topics, hopefully
in depth. It is usually a good sign when the patient says “I’ve never told anyone that before,” or “Only very few people know about this.” In a productive
relationship, the patient might also discover new thoughts and formulations
during the process of confiding in you. The patient may spontaneously remark, “I’ve never thought about this in quite this way until I started talking
about it out loud to you.” When there is a dearth of information, either
clients have successfully resolved their problems and no longer have pressing
concerns, or specific beliefs may be inhibiting the collaboration.
3. Positive affect is expressed. A backdrop of friendliness in the relationship can
be noted by each individual expressing some positive affect, ideally as a
result of the interpersonal exchange. Usually this occurs in a spontaneous
fashion, perhaps as a shared smile or laugh in the course of the therapy
dialogue, or by a sigh of relief and a release of physical tension.
Although humor is typically used judiciously in therapy, the skillful
accomplishment of a positive affective exchange marks a good working relationship. Deeply depressed patients may express only a fleeting smile,
but report an increase in their sense of hope. Anxious patients may relax a
bit, and report feeling more encouraged. The expression of positive affect
can also include some forms of physical contact that fall within professional and clinically appropriate limits. The therapist might offer a handshake or the patient might reach out for a hug. Positive affect that crosses
physical boundaries of intimacy is never appropriate, however. The patient
and therapist do not kiss or hold one another in intimate positions or engage in any questionable physical contact to express positive feelings.
4. Sense of teamwork. Closely related to the expression of positive affect and
the desire for contact is a mutual perception that the patient and therapist
are working effectively as a team. This perception can be checked on a
regular basis by directly asking the patient. The therapist can monitor the
degree of control exhibited during the session and strive for balance and
reciprocity. Therapists must avoid responding to passive behavior in patients by taking over too much control. Allowing the patient to dominate
Developing a Treatment Plan 279
the session with unproductive ruminations, complaints, tangential storytelling or analysis of the problems of other people is just as unproductive.
When there is teamwork, all the participants will feel as though they are
getting somewhere, even if the progress is slow.
5. Negative sentiment is productive. As Safran and Muran (2000) note, there is
general consensus for the notion that strains in the therapeutic relationship are inevitable. The ability to deal therapeutically with negative process is among the most important aspects of a good working relationship.
Do both parties believe that they can confront and effectively use negative feelings or disagreements? If the patient is confused or upset by something the therapist says or suggests, does he or she feel able to speak up? Can
the patient ask questions? Does the therapist detect possible negative reactions in the session and check them out? Does the therapist pick up on disagreement from the patient or is it deflected and ignored? Can the therapist
take criticism without becoming defensive? Does the therapist explore other
possible indicators of negative process as a source of useful information such
as discussing the patient’s ambivalence about continuing in therapy?
In a good working relationship, useful results are drawn from negative
events. We are concerned about the working relationship where everything is
“perfect,” but not much affect, either positive or negative, is being exchanged.
We are most concerned about the working relationship marked by tension and
negative exchange only, with little resolution or sense of productivity attached
to the contact.
Summary
Over a relatively long period of training and development, therapists acquire the
core collaboration skills needed to fulfill the role of being a professional therapist. They also learn specific skills for structuring and directing therapy with
comprehensive treatment plans. Developing and implementing a treatment plan
is as much a matter of caring and confidently engaging the patient in a coherent
approach to problem solving as it is selecting effective techniques and strategies.
Some techniques for effectively engaging patients include focusing attention, resisting distractions, recalling personal information, reserving judgment, and calibrating the structure based on individual responses and feedback.
In addition to collaboration and relationship skills, specific techniques for
structuring treatment are needed to create a sufficient support for the patient’s efforts to change. Chief complaints need to be translated into measurable goals, and
an agreement as to the direction and tasks of therapy needs to be negotiated. It is
useful to keep in mind a plan for self-monitoring the quality of the collaboration,
and not to rely on good intentions as the only measure. Important indicators of a
good working relationship include a motivation to have contact, sharing of emotional information, expression of positive affect, a sense of teamwork, and the
ability to draw productive conclusions from negative sentiments. For all parties
with a stake in the usefulness of therapy, success lies not only in the sophistication
of the treatment plan, but also in a skillfully tended therapeutic relationship.

Therapeutic Methods: Building
Psychotherapy Skills
Psychotherapy is a complex endeavor that requires extensive knowledge
and skill. To become competent as a psychotherapist, you must build a
strong repertoire of conceptual skills, relationship skills, and procedural skills.
Having addressed conceptual and relationship skills in the previous two chapters, we now turn to specific procedures used in psychotherapy.
Learning Objectives
At the end of this chapter, the reader should be able to:
• Discuss the importance of having a range of procedural skills.
• Describe eight interpersonal and systems interventions.
• Describe eight affective interventions.
• Describe eight behavioral interventions.
• Describe eight cognitive interventions.
If you ask 10 laypersons what specific things a psychotherapist does, you
might be very surprised by what you hear. Try this, and see what you discover.
To some, there are few obvious differences between the actions of therapists
and the actions of good friends. Therapists listen, care, and offer supportive
comments as you need them. Others think of therapist actions as similar to a
scolding parent, complete with a wagging index finger, cajoling tone, and unfaltering advice. Still others magnify the therapist’s intellectual powers and infuse the clinical action with a mystical or psychic quality. The therapist absorbs
282 Basic Techniques for Clinicians—Intervention
every detail and applies an elaborate understanding of deep motivations. Yet
another view expects the therapist to assist in emotional catharsis and the release of pent-up feelings. Such therapists would elicit intense affect, and assist
clients in expressive actions such as weeping, shouting, or thumping pillows.
Finally, and perhaps most popular, is the vision of the therapist as being gifted
with perfectly calm insight, quickly ascertaining the sources of emotional distress, and dispensing concrete, direct, and effective solutions. This therapist,
like the scolding parent, seems to have all the answers and can tell you how to
fix yourself in a few simple steps, without the authoritarian tone. In reality, all
these impressions are based on some kernel of truth about the specific interventions that therapists use.
Each of these descriptions is based on a different snapshot of the relevant
content of therapy, and the associated procedures or methods. Therapists have
traditionally identified themselves in one or another of these snapshots on the
basis of their chosen school or system of approach to psychotherapy. Clientcentered therapists are warm facilitators; psychodynamic therapists are intrapsychic interpreters; humanistic therapists are guides for personal discovery
and expression; and cognitive-behavioral therapists are coping skill dispensers.
Decades of accumulated research on the effectiveness of different systems
of psychotherapy have gradually induced a paradigm shift toward understanding the foundations of psychotherapy as a flexible set of procedures applied in
the context of a clinical relationship. Whether clinicians conceptualize psychotherapy as a set of empirically supported treatments designed to ameliorate specific clinical syndromes (e.g., Chambless & Hollon, 1998) or as empirically
supported relationships that are designed to meet the needs of specific persons
(e.g., Norcross, 2002; Wampold, 2001), adherence to a single school of therapy
and one-size-fits-all methods is increasingly outdated. As Norcross notes, “The
research shows an effective psychotherapist is one who employs specific methods, who offers strong relationships, and who customizes both discrete methods and relationship stances to the individual person and condition.”(2002,
p. 13). In essence, we are moving away from an “allegiance” model of practice
where the psychologist makes a categorical decision to adopt a single theoretical orientation and toward a broader scientific model where the psychologist integrates empirical information into a biopsychosocial model of human
behavior. The core units of competence with the biopsychosocial model are the
ability to think critically and to approach clinical phenomena in a systematic
and unbiased manner.
Applying Specific Procedures
As you read about specific procedures, keep in mind that the success of any intervention depends in part on the context in which it is applied. In practice,
both instrumental and interpersonal dimensions are part of the same context,
and have a reciprocal interaction (Safran & Muran, 2000). The usefulness and
potency, for good or ill, of any procedure is highly affected by when and how
the therapist applies it, for what purpose, and how the patient feels about it.
Therapeutic Methods: Building Psychotherapy Skills 283
The procedure may be well tested and useful in a general sense, but not workable in a given clinical situation for any number of reasons. The explanation of
the procedure may be insufficient, it may not suit the learning style of the particular patient, it may be awkward or uncomfortable to either party, or it may
be peripheral to the patient’s current problems, just to name a few possibilities.
Thus, you may find that these potentially effective procedures do not always
work in the straightforward way that our examples suggest.
Effectively using a broad range of procedures requires conceptual and
technical skill, timing, and interpersonal rapport. Stuffing a large number of
techniques into a given client’s therapy will not necessarily lead to better outcome. Overreliance on techniques or over-using a few techniques can make
therapy shallow and gimmicky. Forcing a particular procedure on a reluctant
client is perhaps the riskiest venture because the therapist might be confusing
the procedure with conceptualization, thinking that the essence of therapy is
defined by some prototypic action. The therapist may be caught in a “should”
and “must” trap about techniques of therapy. For example, the therapist might
think that every cognitive therapy session must include an automatic thought
record. There are many risks in this sort of rigidity, including the risk of alienating the client from the opportunity of therapy.
Readers should keep in mind both the interpersonal and clinical context
for any procedure. The following sections describe some of the basic tools with
which the provider can craft a more comprehensive intervention. These are not
intended to be exhaustive summaries, but rather a foundation of procedures for
building basic practice. For the sake of discussion, these procedures are divided
into interpersonal and systems, affective, behavioral, and cognitive categories,
reflecting the primary mode of the intervention. Each category includes descriptions of eight useful intervention procedures. In practice, these interventions are often combined and applied in the context of a collaborative
relationship. Other relevant factors including the principles, stages, and levels
of change are also part of the conceptualization that guides selection of procedures such as those described here.
Interpersonal and Systems Interventions
Interpersonal and systems interventions are geared toward functional
changes in patterns of communication and processes of social and group interactions. Depending on how the client presents for therapy, interventions of
this type may be appropriate early, in the middle, later, or instead of individually focused work. Clients with a chaotic, neglectful, controlling, or otherwise unstable family history may especially need to address the interpersonal
components of their problems. Interpersonal interventions develop skills and
interactions needed for effective functioning within relationships and groups.
For a given client, there may be internal barriers to more effective functioning
such as faulty beliefs or pent-up feelings that need to be addressed with affective and cognitive interventions either before or concomitant with interpersonal changes.
284 Basic Techniques for Clinicians—Intervention
Family and Cultural History
Family processes play a pivotal role in the psychosocial development of individual members. This is especially true for the impact of a family of origin on its
children, as some degree of connection to these family processes is present
throughout an individual’s life span. Family patterns are also embedded within
a cultural context of values, beliefs, and affiliations that shape the norms
within a family for acceptable behavior and expected family functioning (Teyber, 2006).
All approaches to therapy include at least an overview of family and cultural experiences that affected an individual’s child and adolescent development. Most core beliefs and associated behaviors have their origins in these
early experiences. The task of reviewing a family history can take an oral narrative form in therapy sessions or it can be written as a homework assignment
and discussed in the sessions. Yet another option is to illustrate a complete,
cross-generational family history with a formal genogram (McGoldrick, Gerson, & Shellenberger, 1999). The objective in such explorations is to better understand the client’s behavioral and emotional learning history. Hypotheses
can be drawn about the beliefs and conclusions the client formulated concerning the self and other people on the basis of these experiences with significant
others.
Interactions with family may have shaped the personal beliefs “I am
unimportant,” and “other people will reject my needs.” When activated, these
beliefs will likely show up in current interactions discussed in therapy, and in
relating to the therapist. Connecting beliefs to the family history spotlights the
implicit, inflexible and durable nature of these ideas as the basis for a pattern of
relating to the self and the world.
When these beliefs arise during the therapy interaction (e.g., if the client
is overly apologetic about rescheduling an appointment), the therapist can spot
the activation of the core belief and help the client recognize the pattern and
learn to discriminate the past from the present. In addition, the healing process
includes helping the client to realistically understand family events and coalitions and to come to terms with both the good news and the bad news in their
families (Teyber, 2006). Important areas to explore include family economic
and health history, major events, cultural affiliations, affective and behavioral
rules, and the impact of any family secrets.
Case Example
Donna came to therapy because of acute
anxiety problems. Her mother had died
suddenly a few years ago, and ever since
then, Donna has suffered recurrent
panic attacks and depression. Her childhood had been economically, socially,
and geographically unstable, with her
mother as the source of reassurance
during tough times. Her father was a
minister who moved from church to
church, eventually alienating each successive congregation with his stern,
judgmental, and self-centered attitudes.
He made favorable first impressions
Therapeutic Methods: Building Psychotherapy Skills 285
Trace an Interpersonal Developmental Time Line
An overview of the client’s personal developmental time line in terms of interpersonal skills, challenges and resources can refine global self-perceptions and
activate a hopeful perspective. Being in a state of distress often produces memory distortions such that current difficulties are recalled as being continuously
present, and are then projected to either stay just as bad or worsen indefinitely
into the future. The client says, “It’s always been this bad, I’ve been a misfit my
whole life. If I am not any better with my relationships now, how am I ever
going to face the challenges of my future? I’ll certainly fail and be alone forever.” If encouraged to test the accuracy of this thought directly, the client is
most likely to defend the perception as true.
Another way to test the accuracy of this generalization is to go back in time.
For many clients, it may be useful to begin the time line in childhood, perhaps
Case Example (Continued)
with his impassioned approach to religious leadership, but inevitably he
would cross the wrong person and have
to move on to another locale. He was
emotionally distant and punitive with
his children, and he expected most of all
that they should make him look good in
public. The children were strongly admonished not to discuss their father’s
methods of corporal punishment outside
their home, and they were not allowed
to talk back to him. Donna learned “I
must seek the approval of others,” and
“other people are threats to my safety.”
At her mother’s funeral, Donna had
the opportunity to have contact with
her mother’s family, with whom they
had very little communication over the
years. She even met several cousins and
their families for the first time and
found them to be warm and charming.
This did not fit at all with the negative
image of heathen, immoral alcoholabusers that had been offered by her
parents as the reason for the family distance. In talking with her maternal
aunt, Donna discovered the true reason
for their distance had been her own
mother’s shame over her father’s instability and abusive behavior toward the
children and her father’s controlling attitudes about family associations. There
was a history of alcoholism in her
mother’s family, which was the main
reason that her father had discouraged
and even forbidden their contact.
Donna was now redefining her family relationships, including her family
of origin and her extended family of
in-laws. She wanted to be more assertive and increase her contact with
her mother’s family and decrease her
contact with her father, and limit her
interactions with certain in-laws who
seemed to be highly status oriented,
but she found this triggered her global
fears of disapproval. In discussing her
choices with her therapist, it became
evident in their interaction that she
was also seeking the therapist’s endorsement as part of the interpersonal
pattern of her core belief about the
need for approval of her actions.
286 Basic Techniques for Clinicians—Intervention
their preschool years, and inquire about interpersonal functioning in segments of
time proceeding through their development. The perspective gained by this exercise, in addition to a vast wealth of information about their life history, is often
one of ups and downs. At a broad level, the global conclusion that “I’ve always
been a misfit,” is disconfirmed by the historical review. Important information
about functional relationships can be used in planning current options and alternatives (see cognitive interventions).
Take a Current Interpersonal Inventory
People interact within interpersonal circles and social networks. Taking an i




ventory of current interpersonal relationships provides a systematic way to
focus on these relationships. Important dimensions of these relationships can
then be discussed, such as degree of intimacy, frequency of communication,
power and influence, and connections with specific group affiliations. An adequately populated and functioning social network is needed to satisfy individual emotional needs for companionship and enjoyment. Affiliations with
others also create a social reference group and a means of constructing and
maintaining a social identity. A current inventory can pinpoint gaps and possible deficits as well as areas of tension or conflict. This inventory can begin with
a list of important current relationships as well as more casual contacts or acquaintances, followed by an exploration of potential areas of discomfort, difficulty, and potential change.
Clinical Example
When Jan lamented that she had been
a “reject” her whole life, her therapist
remarked that this was indeed an exceptionally rare problem. Because success and failure are typically coexisting
processes that come and go in everyone’s life, it might be important to understand how Jan could have only
continuous failure. Usually the feelings
of success or failure wax and wane over
time as life tasks are alternately easier
or more difficult.
So to really get a sense of this in any
one particular life, it is useful to trace a
time line with notation of any recognizable successes or failures. They began, in
a systematic way, to trace Jan’s life experiences in segments of 5 years, beginning from birth to age five, when Jan
succeeded in many interpersonal tasks
(forming a place in her family, learning
basic verbal manners such as “please”
and “thank-you,” attended mother’s day
out), but perhaps failed in others (too
afraid of the other children to ride the
bus to school). The time line continued
in this way, traced out on successive
sheets of paper, bringing interpersonal
experiences and skills into the present
day. In the end, many forgotten or unacknowledged successes were brought to
light, and failures were put into perspective, so Jan’s overall conclusions
about her interpersonal skills and value
were less globally negative and failure
oriented.

Explore Roles and Role Transitions
Most people will assume different social roles over the course of a lifetime.
From student to apprentice to friend, relative, coworker, adult, boss, teacher,
parent, spouse, neighbor, classmate, professional or many others, our social
roles have a fundamental impact on our psychological sense of self and worth.
Some of our roles are deeply invested with meaning whereas others may be
considered peripheral or relatively unimportant. Being a parent may be central
for some while roles held for employment are simply jobs that are necessary to
pay the bills. For others, career roles have high priority, but family roles are incidental. Most people strive for some balance of family and career roles as both
are important to their sense of self.
Difficulties with role adjustment are possible targets for therapeutic intervention when psychosocial roles are ambiguous, overloaded, or ill-fitted to the
skills or expectations of the individual. Many role difficulties will emerge during a time of transition, when any discrepancy between the skills and abilities
of the individual and the role demands becomes apparent. This may occur because the person does not fully understand the tasks and demands, does not
have the skills for fulfilling the demands or has become incapacitated by the increasing demands of multiple roles or significantly more complex roles. Discussion of the specific expectations and requirements of the role and the process of
change can help mobilize a more effective coping perspective. When needed,
Clinical Example
Ray was depressed and lonely. He was
estranged from his extended family, his
father was deceased, his mother was in
a nursing home due to severe and progressive dementia, and his only sibling
lived in a distant state and was disabled
by years of alcohol and drug abuse. He
and his wife were separated but not divorced due to religious reasons, and
they rarely spoke. His work as a consultant required regular travel throughout
the country for short-term assignments,
and as a result, he had no work colleagues to speak of. His office was in his
home, where he lived alone. Because of
his work travel, he kept no pets. He no
longer attended church and he belonged
to no groups or associations.
Ray’s interpersonal network had
such a deficit in the number of people
that he was basically interpersonally
impoverished. His social skills for casual interactions were strong, as he had
no problem traveling about and interacting with new people in different
work settings all the time. However, his
skills in making and establishing more
intimate friendships and relationships
that would continue past a fleeting
contact were much more limited. In addition, conflicts and tensions from his
family of origin affected not only the
number of people participating in his
life, but his willingness to risk trust and
intimacy with others.

specific skill development may help with role adjustment. For example, retirement planning classes may help with the shift from full-time professional to
part-time volunteer.
Provide Instruction in Assertive Communication Skills
This intervention involves assisting clients in recognizing and choosing to express their thoughts and feelings in a manner that is conducive to effective social interactions. The focus of the intervention is the behavioral expression of
clients’ underlying feelings in ways that show respect for both self and others.
This intervention has several components. First, the client learns to recognize signs of unassertiveness, such as being too passive and feeling victimized
or disappointed, or signs of being too aggressive, demanding, or inattentive to
Clinical Example
Mark came to therapy at the insistence
of his wife, Renee, who was at her wit’s
end with role overload. She was working full time, taking care of their infant
daughter, and helping Mark’s mother
deal with breast cancer and a failing
business. Mark had completed a college
degree in music education and a master’s degree in educational administration, but he had yet to apply for any
jobs. Instead, he spent his days at home,
smoking pot and playing video games.
Renee took the baby to day-care,
worked all day at an administrative job
she disliked, picked up the baby, and returned home, only to be greeted by
Mark, sitting on the sofa surrounded by
mess, asking “what do you want to do
about dinner?” Mark would then go to
the supermarket, if Renee gave him a
list, although he might get sidetracked
by stopping off to visit with friends
along the way. Mark was comfortable
in his role of extended adolescence, but
was on the verge of failure in fulfilling
the new roles of spouse and father. Part
of Mark’s difficulty was role ambiguity.
He had not given much thought to the
actual changes that were taking place
in his life and thus did not become oriented toward the new roles. He was
still in his mid-20s and he viewed adult
responsibilities as something for his
30s. This was still the time for having
fun, and as long as Renee was working
and they could pay their bills, he did
not see the need to make any changes.
Sometimes role transitions can be
eased by obtaining practical help from
other people, at least until the skills
needed for the new role can be fully developed. Some roles are demanding precisely because there added or more
complex responsibilities. Sometimes delegation to others is unavoidable. The
client may not have attempted to obtain
help because of the effort or expense, because of being unfamiliar or uncomfortable with doing so, or because assistance
was not readily available. Many people
either are in a practical situation where
they do not have ready access to people
as resources, or are in a psychological situation where they avoid this option.
There may be internal cognitive or emotional barriers to this process (e.g., “I
should be able to handle all this myself; I
am failing if I do not.”). However, at a
fundamental practical level, it is important to ask whether the role strain could
be eased by obtaining assistance.
Therapeutic Methods: Building Psychotherapy Skills 289
the rights of others. Second, the client practices consideration of the possible
choices for expressing thoughts and feelings in the context of specific situations. Therapists can discuss with the client different ways to assert feelings,
such as refusing an offer, expressing an opinion, or making a request, and practice some actual words or statements to use.
These actions need to be placed in an overall context for effectiveness in a
social situation. For example, refusing an offer from a nervous second-grader
who is trying to sell gift wrap for her school is very different from refusing a
sales pitch from a professional salesperson offering timeshare vacation condominiums. The benefits of assertive communication will likely be greatest when
sufficient consideration of mutual respect (respecting both the rights of self and
the rights of others) and social context is given. Thus, this technique involves
developing skills in recognizing one’s feelings, sizing up the situation, and
choosing a response, as well as finding some effective words and using them in
a respectful way. The essence of assertiveness may rest in the recognition of the
choices available in social situations, and the specific exercise of a choice.
Routines and Rituals
Routines and rituals help to stabilize individual and group systems by ensuring
that crucial tasks are completed. Informal routines of daily habits provide a
structure that gives continuity and a sense of security to ambiguous and repetitive situations.
Encourage the client’s use of routine to stabilize behavior or improve the
efficiency of important tasks. Having a particular sequence of behavior at bedtime can help ensure a restful night of sleep. Getting back to the routines of
Clinical Example
Thirteen-year-old Ian was embarrassed
and angry with his math teacher for habitually mispronouncing his name with
a long vowel sound like “eye,” and teasingly referring to him as the “eye-man.”
Thus far, Ian had said nothing to the
teacher, but he had gotten a detention
for talking in his class and not paying
attention. Ian and his therapist noted
that he was feeling distressed and angry, but his behavior was passive and
indirect, possible signs of unassertiveness. His therapist pointed out that although it might not be easy, Ian did
have the option of sharing his feelings
more directly with the teacher, and
making a request. They considered the
best time to initiate this communication and practiced the specific actions
with a role-play. Ian decided to stay after school and approach his teacher
when there was less likelihood of anyone else being around. He practiced acknowledging possible thoughts and
feelings of the teacher, acknowledging
his own feelings, and making a request.
His intended communication was to
sound something like this: “Mr. Green,
I know you like to make things funny
in class, but I get embarrassed being
called eye-man. I would like it better if
you would use the pronunciation of my
name that my parents use, which is eean. Thanks.”
290 Basic Techniques for Clinicians—Intervention
everyday living with designated times for regular tasks can be stabilizing in the
wake of a traumatic event, or in recovering from a significant loss. From reading the newspaper every morning to exercise on Monday-Wednesday-Friday to
grocery shopping and laundry on Saturday to eating waffles on Sunday, the
regular routine provides consistency and direction. Key to an effectively functioning system, is the ability to adjust routines as needed to meet temporary demands for flexibility.
Formal rituals also serve important emotional functions. Cultural rituals
such as weddings, funerals, graduations, and holiday gatherings create a sanctioned way to acknowledge membership within the group. Participating in such
rituals gives the individual an impetus to focus on the emotional component of
the relationships, to express emotions in a social context, to acknowledge both
change and continuity in relationships and groups and to attach meaning to
specific social commitment.
Attending a funeral of someone who has died usually helps us process our
own feelings of grief, loss, and separation by sharing those feelings with other
loved ones, recognizing the social changes precipitated by the death, and gaining perspective on the importance of friends, family members, or even fond acquaintances. Other more joyful rituals help us and those around us recognize
our movement through life (e.g., graduations, weddings, christenings, birthday
parties) and attach certain emotions and meaning to that movement. The obvious exception to this strategy is the problem of obsessive-compulsive behavior
that involves excessive and senseless rituals that interfere with normal living.
Family and Collateral Meetings
Consultation with family members or significant others can be useful in many
therapeutic contexts. Sometimes the family unit is the focus of treatment and
all sessions involve some combination of family members. Usually one person
is the identified patient and any others present are identified as “collateral” participants. Family consultations are usually actively structured and directed by
the therapist in pursuit of specific goals. Typical goals for collateral consultaClinical Example
Molly felt enduring guilt about having
had an affair with a married man when
she was in college, even after extensive
work with cognitive reframing. Although it had been a long while since she
had participated in religious services, she
was receptive to the idea of attending
services designed for atonement. She decided to attend services with an attitude
of simply participating in the ritual and
being open to whatever might occur. In
reporting back to her therapist, she described a wonderful and liberating experience that crystallized when she read a
particular scriptural passage that she had
not fully noticed in the past. The passage
instructed the reader to turn away from
sin and to live; in reading this, she saw
the intended message as letting go of her
guilt and moving forward with her life.

tions include one or more of the following: gathering information, sharing information among participants, providing psychoeducation, identifying primary
concerns, expressing feelings, improving communication patterns and skills,
communicating about progress and change, facilitating stress management,
conflict resolution or problem solving, and evaluating and stabilizing roles and
emotional involvement.
Balance Autonomy and Relationship/Group Affiliation
Our culture is very heterogeneous with respect to an emphasis on individual
pursuits over social and familial commitments (see Chapter 3). We tend to endorse the freedom to pursue one’s true inner self, yet we still define one another and ourselves through various relationships and memberships. This
freedom can bring confusion or tension regarding a functional balance between personal fulfillment and social connection. Clients may come to therapy
as a result of the stress of such conflicts and need help reconciling their beliefs,
overcoming barriers that stand in the way of their choices, and recognizing behavioral options for personal and interpersonal involvements.
Signs of this imbalance might include feeling controlled by a relationship
or group membership, feeling stretched too thin and having no personal time at
all, not being able to say no to demands or expectations out of a fear of the social consequences, feeling compelled to do things that are personally harmful
or inconsistent with one’s values, becoming alienated from one’s priorities and
personal goals, or feeling alone and disconnected from any sense of belonging
to a community or dissatisfied and searching for something missing. The focus
of this intervention is to help the client see available choices for both making
and limiting interpersonal involvements with the goal of striking a personal
Clinical Example
Eloise’s severe arthritis at age 75 had
advanced to where she required a fulltime caregiver in her home. She was
delighted to have Robin with her each
day to help with dressing, bathing, eating, light correspondence, and outings
such as trips to the doctor and hairstylist. Each night, either Eloise’s husband
or his sister stayed with her in case she
needed any assistance during the night.
Eloise had been in intermittent
therapy for approximately 25 years for
recurrent depression and severe obsessive anxiety. Recently, she was devastated to find out that her husband had
a long-standing intimate relationship
with a younger woman that he was
unwilling to end. When Eloise returned for individual therapy, her therapist included some collateral visits
with Robin and Eloise as part of the
treatment plan. Robin provided information on Eloise’s mood, revealing
clear shifts related to the husband’s
comings and goings, particularly if he
was gone all night. Eloise was able to
express her appreciation to Robin for
her emotional support, and the therapist was able to provide Robin with
guidance and encouragement on managing the emotional and interpersonal
challenges of this situation.
292 Basic Techniques for Clinicians—Intervention
balance that is healthy and functional. Using or developing assertive communication skills may be a part of implementing the choices in this intervention.
The behavioral implications of the client’s choices are to increase, decrease, or redirect selected interpersonal contacts. A client who does not want
to date a drinker would do well to steer clear of bars, nightclubs, and drinking
parties, and seek friendships through nondrinking venues. If a client thinks he
would enjoy more intellectual stimulation from others, enrolling in a class
might make this accessible. If a client would like to meet others with similar
political interests, it might be useful to volunteer for a political campaign.
Affective Interventions
Affective interventions are focused primarily on the experience of emotions
and bodily sensations. Objectives of affective interventions are to increase conscious awareness of the emotional components of an experience or situation, to
reduce avoidance of an affective reaction, to increase the client’s tolerance of
emotional experience, and to assist in the functional use of emotion. The overall goal is to shape the recognition of a range of affective states as a source of
vital information in adaptive living.
Intensity and authenticity are elements of the client’s subjective emotional experience that represent individual differences, and should be respected
Clinical Example
Ryan enjoyed his sales manager position, but the job required a great deal
of entertaining and socializing on the
nights and weekends. These work
events always included alcohol and
there was much heavy drinking by the
sales staff and the customers. Now that
he was married and had a young child,
Ryan wanted to spend more of his
evenings and weekends with his family.
He also wanted to pursue his hobby of
cycling for sport and fitness, but this
was an interest that few of his customers or coworkers shared. He felt as
though he had more bases than he
could reasonably cover and began to
think that his life was not going in the
direction he most desired. The significant financial rewards of his sales job
made Ryan feel successful, and he felt
strong bonds with several of his
coworkers, including the regional manager who was his mentor and “like a father figure.” When he tried to reduce
his contact with the socializing and
drinking, Ryan received much direct
and indirect pressure from his colleagues to maintain the status quo.
Ryan eventually decided that it was in
his best interest to make a career
change altogether. He resigned from his
position, began attending AA (Alcoholics Anonymous) to stop drinking,
and enrolled in a master’s degree program to earn his teaching certificate.

as such. The clinician wants to avoid any implication that there is a “right” or
“proper” type or degree of emotion for any given situation. The expression of
emotion (e.g., anger) may have functional and dysfunctional parameters that
can be addressed with other behavioral, cognitive, or systems interventions.
Mindfulness Practice
There are many strategies of mindfulness practice (see Hanh, 1987; Hayes,
Strosahl, & Wilson, 1999; Linehan, 1993; Segal, Williams, & Teasdale, 2002).
The common thread among these approaches is the focusing of awareness on
internal components of experience and increasing one’s skill in observing perceptions, sensations, and thoughts without attempting to change them. Mindfulness can be done in a quiet, eyes-closed state, or it can be practiced during
an activity such as walking, folding laundry, or eating. This practice often has a
calming effect, although that is not a direct objective. Regular mindfulness
practice is intended to decrease the fusion between problematic thoughts or
emotions and actions, and promote greater awareness of the different dimensions of experience as contents of the mind.
Clinical Example
Betty kept worrying about a family situation that was beyond her control. It was
getting to the point that she barely noticed what she was doing during the day
as her mind focused on the family circumstance. She was instructed in mindfulness practice as a way to help herself
live fully with her experience of worry
and concern. Each day, for 10 minutes,
she would sit in a quiet place and focus
her attention on feeling herself breathing, noticing any bodily sensations as
they occurred, without struggling with
those sensations or trying to get rid of
them. She practiced noticing the content
of her mind, without judging or evaluating it, or pursuing the content in any directed way. She would notice that
worries about her family were popping
into her mind, but she did not attempt
either to get rid of them, or to try to
search for possible solutions. She simply
refocused her attention on breathing
again and again, and would always conclude the exercise with attention to her
breathing.
Emotional Deepening and Validation
Helping clients identify, deepen, or extend their understanding of the emotion,
and accept rather than deny or reject the experience is a fundamental affective
technique. This begins with listening actively for indications of emotional content, and providing reflective feedback to the client. Bringing explicit attention
to the emotional domain, and helping to provide labels for the emotions gives
importance to this dimension of the client’s personal experience, and can help
articulate the experience (see L. S. Greenberg et al., 1993; Linehan, 1993).
294 Basic Techniques for Clinicians—Intervention
Beginning therapists are often prone to underestimate the importance of
this technique and become frustrated with “just listening and not doing anything.” To overcome this error, it is helpful to realize the potential benefit in
skillfully attending to emotional content, appropriately drawing this into the
discussion, encouraging the client to attend to the thoughts and sensations that
are aroused, and providing crucial social support in the form of validating the
understandable triggers of the emotional response.
Clients may have in the past or present encountered those who invalidate
their emotions (“You shouldn’t be depressed; cheer up!”), and they may have
acquired the habit of invalidating their own emotions. Effective listening and
validation by the therapist will often, but not always, help clients reduce their
level of distress, and begin to induce some positive affect as well as a greater receptiveness to problem-solving or suggestion.
Clinical Example
Kay was troubled by family interactions
with her parents. In the following dialogue, the therapist draws emotional
content explicitly into the discussion
and validates Kay’s experience.
Kay: It’s weird when my parents visit.
They’re really a big help with the
kids and all, but they’re so messy,
and they’re always giving me advice
about what my husband should be
doing better.
Therapist: So some conflicting feelings
come up when they visit. It sounds
like you feel happy and grateful for
their help with the kids, but uncomfortable with the unwanted help
with your husband, and the added
stress of more mess in your house.
Kay: (Nods) Uh huh. I don’t want to be
ungrateful, or take advantage of
them, and I do want them to visit,
and have a relationship with the
kids. Oh, I don’t know. I should just
count my blessings and stop griping.
Therapist: Well, we can certainly take
some time to talk about ways to deal
with these feelings that make you
want to gripe. But first, let’s take
time for you to understand those
feelings and have room to have them.
It makes sense to me that you would
feel pulled in two directions given
these circumstances, feeling both
grateful and annoyed at the same
time. Does that describe some of
your experience?
Kay: Yes. I think I’m mainly annoyed
with myself that I can’t just ignore
what they say about Bob and go on.
Therapist: Do you feel that tension inside yourself right now?
Kay: (tearing up) Yes. My throat and
stomach are tight. I just don’t know
how to respond to what they say, so I
just try to blow it off.
Therapist: Well, it seems logical that a
person would feel some tension and
distress when two feelings are conflicting like this, especially when
those feelings are related to such important relationships.
This dialogue would continue with
exploring the client’s feelings and eventually move toward problem solving,
encouraging the client to recognize how
she tends to invalidate and dismiss her
own feelings and modeling an alternative of acceptance via the therapeutic
interaction.
Therapeutic Methods: Building Psychotherapy Skills 295
Interoceptive Exposure
The experience of an affective state may trigger a reaction of fear and avoidance, perhaps because of beliefs related to the unacceptability of certain feelings or their outward expressions, or possible dangerousness of the internal
sensations. Avoiding these internal sensations can lead to broad and elaborate
networks of avoidance and safety behavior.
For lasting change to occur, it may be necessary to work directly on exposure to the actual sensations, to increase tolerance and decrease the sense of associated threat, and to detect any especially problematic thoughts connected to
the sensation. The particular internal sensations feared by the client will be
unique, but are typically associated with an uncomfortable or undesirable outcome, such as choking, collapsing, or dying. Interoceptive exposure involves
activating those sensations, typically in low to medium intensity, to allow for
deconstruction of the sensation in physical terms (e.g., just tension in the muscles) and greater tolerance for the physical experience as well as recognition of
its passing nature, thus decreasing the perceived threat and concomitant fear of
the sensation.
Willingness Exercises
Willingness interventions are exercises of the client’s choice to pursue a desired
activity with the understanding that certain undesired emotions may occur. The
exercise is one of being willing to have the emotion if it occurs, and still carry
on with the plan. So the client might choose to be willing to go to work, even
though depression or a sad mood might occur. Or the client might choose to
give a presentation, even though anxiety might be part of the experience. The
objective of these exercises is to pursue behaviors or activities that are important to the client and give meaning to their life, without trying to control all
emotional components of the experience. The client is practicing the willingness to have emotions.
Clinical Example
When Bob felt panicky, he was especially troubled by tension in his throat,
difficulty in swallowing, and a choking
sensation. These symptoms were explained as due to muscle tension activated by a fear response and not
indicative of any state of medical compromise. Bob had recently been evaluated medically and was deemed to be in
good health. With his therapist’s
prompting, Bob practiced bringing on
the sensations of tension in his throat
and chest. He was instructed to tighten
the muscles in his throat, and then to
stop a swallow half-way through and
hold it for 30 seconds. Then he tightened his chest and held his breath for
45 seconds. This was repeated several
times, each time discussing the degree
of distress Bob felt with the sensations,
noting that his distress went down with
repeated exposures.
296 Basic Techniques for Clinicians—Intervention
Values Assessment
Values exercises bring out the client’s emotional investment in various life activities. Values are pursuits or roles that have an importance for the client that
will typically endure across time and situations. Some values may be more
salient at different times in life, and thus matter more because of developmental demands. Being a good parent may take priority over other important values
when the client is raising young children. An unmarried, childless client may
highly value being a good parent, but other values such as career or friendships
have more immediate salience. We can help clients detect the strength of their
attachment to various values, and connect this to the direction of their energy.
Clinical Example
Shirley prepared a special healthy
snack for her daughter’s first-grade
class and then felt humiliated when the
children did not like it. She was so upset by this personal failure that she was
not willing to have any further contact
with her child’s school or class activities. For a time, she had required her
husband leave work early to pick up
their daughter because she “couldn’t
show her face” at the school.
Being an involved mother was important to her, so she agreed to challenge herself to experience some
undesired emotions to care for her
daughter. First, she returned to school
pickup, and when she did so, she felt an
“anxious rush” while waiting in the car
line. She was instructed to simply ask
herself whether she was willing to have
that feeling, and to encourage willingness. She found the anxious feelings
subsided rather quickly as soon as her
child got in the car. After 2 weeks of
regular pickup, a day of late activity required her to go to the classroom.
Again, she made note of the physical
sensations, including blushing and feeling fearful and slightly nauseous, and
focused on her willingness to have
these feelings in the service of being the
mother she wanted to be. She continued this same exercise of willingness
over and over, until Shirley felt that she
had resumed all her previous activities.
By this time, Shirley was even ready to
try again with a snack for the class
Valentine’s Day party, and was willing
to experience whatever came up in this
endeavor.
Clinical Example
Phillip was in therapy for motivational
problems at work. In exploring his
overall values, Phillip was asked to
close his eyes and imagine his funeral.
In this fantasy exercise, anything was
possible, so he was to select all the people he wanted to attend his funeral, not
just those he thought would attend. He
then imagined selecting someone to
speak about him, and what that person
would say. He then imagined two or
three more people speaking about him, 
Therapeutic Methods: Building Psychotherapy Skills 297
Metaphors
Metaphors offer the opportunity of both a memorable way to present a concept
of change, and an indirect mode of suggestion that may minimize reactance or
resistance. A visually vivid metaphor can create an image that crystallizes an
abstract concept that might be difficult to remember in verbal form. Many clinical metaphors have been developed and tested for use in the clinical approach
of acceptance and commitment therapy (ACT; Hayes et al., 1999). In addition to
using common metaphors, selecting metaphors for change principles can be
guided by the client’s own life experiences and interests.
Clinical Example (Continued)
and what they would say about his actions, his intentions, and his impact on
others. After the fantasy concluded
with some final words about how he
would be missed and remembered,
Phillip and his therapist reviewed his
reactions.
Phillip discovered that he wanted
people to recognize him as a devoted
member of his church and a willing
participant in charitable activities. He
imagined the church filled with dozens
of people who had known him for a
long time, many of whom attested to
his extensive contributions to the community. He also felt that, in the end, his
work success was relatively unimportant, and that his current motivation
issues were probably related to the
greater sense of priority he gave to
charitable activities. This helped him
also recognize that his primary motivation for work was to create stability and
social standing for his family, and not to
produce greater profits for the business.
With a clearer sense of why he was
pursuing his work, he overcame some
of his avoidance and frustration.
Clinical Example
Cathy felt overwhelmed when faced
with important decisions. She struggled
with several dimensions of decision
making, including the fear of making
a mistake, failing to make the right
choice, and feeling uncertain about
her own preferences. She identified a
metaphor that explained how she went
about making decisions, whenever possible, and the degree of certainty that
she perceived was necessary in making
a good decision. When she was small,
she had a favorite book that was entitled, Patty Likes Pink. The story depicted
a child who always knew what she
wanted, confidently choosing pink.
Patty was untroubled by doubt and seldom, if ever, experienced disappointment, because she lived entirely in a
world of pink. For Cathy, the story was
a metaphor for the desire to remove all
doubt, uncertainty, and risk of disappointment, but at the cost of a limited
scope of experience.

Imagery Replacement
Images can be brought under conscious cognitive influence, much the same as
other verbal constructions. In instances where a client lacks positive images, or
tends to recall only negative images, a direct activation of positive or coping images may induce a more positive association or greater willingness to approach a
difficult situation. Positive images can also be used as a distraction technique for
disrupting ruminative thoughts, dwelling on intrusive or negative images, or
coping with a difficult or painful experience. The objective should not be to suppress or avoid the occurrence of any particular thought, but rather to prompt
the access to positive, enjoyable, or coping images. Creating a picture in the
mind activates the positive affect associated with the image.
Clinical Example
Marge, an elder client who was depressed since the death of her spouse,
had frequent visual images and memories of her husband in his sickbed, and
deceased at his funeral. She understood
these images were naturally going to
come into her mind. She did not try to
suppress them as they were part of a
grieving process. However, she was also
encouraged to activate additional images drawn from her memories of the
couple’s happy times together. She recalled the image of them on their wedding day, and some images from their
honeymoon. She remembered images
of the two of them on a camping trip,
holding hands and being close. Marge
found it very pleasant to linger on these
images, and to enjoy in her mind the
sense of being with her spouse and enjoying the soothing warmth of a campfire together.
Expressive Monologue
An expressive monologue is an exercise to help clients articulate feelings that
have been suppressed or unresolved for various reasons. The key element is
that the monologue is directed toward a specific person or group, approximating the experience of clients actually telling the person how they feel.
Sometimes this is referred to as the “empty chair” exercise, because it is
useful to imagine the person present, and to talk as if he or she is listening.
There may be a dialogue component to the exercise as well, where the recipient’s responses are included and a conversation enacted. Expressive monologue
can also be carried out in written form, perhaps as a letter to the designated
person. The letter is primarily for expressive purposes and is not necessarily
going to be sent. The client will choose that after completing the exercise. The
therapist can provide support and encouragement throughout the expression of
feelings.


Psychotherapy is a complex endeavor that requires extensive knowledge
and skill. To become competent as a psychotherapist, you must build a
strong repertoire of conceptual skills, relationship skills, and procedural skills.
Having addressed conceptual and relationship skills in the previous two chapters, we now turn to specific procedures used in psychotherapy.
Learning Objectives
At the end of this chapter, the reader should be able to:
• Discuss the importance of having a range of procedural skills.
• Describe eight interpersonal and systems interventions.
• Describe eight affective interventions.
• Describe eight behavioral interventions.
• Describe eight cognitive interventions.
If you ask 10 laypersons what specific things a psychotherapist does, you
might be very surprised by what you hear. Try this, and see what you discover.
To some, there are few obvious differences between the actions of therapists
and the actions of good friends. Therapists listen, care, and offer supportive
comments as you need them. Others think of therapist actions as similar to a
scolding parent, complete with a wagging index finger, cajoling tone, and unfaltering advice. Still others magnify the therapist’s intellectual powers and infuse the clinical action with a mystical or psychic quality. The therapist absorbs
282 Basic Techniques for Clinicians—Intervention
every detail and applies an elaborate understanding of deep motivations. Yet
another view expects the therapist to assist in emotional catharsis and the release of pent-up feelings. Such therapists would elicit intense affect, and assist
clients in expressive actions such as weeping, shouting, or thumping pillows.
Finally, and perhaps most popular, is the vision of the therapist as being gifted
with perfectly calm insight, quickly ascertaining the sources of emotional distress, and dispensing concrete, direct, and effective solutions. This therapist,
like the scolding parent, seems to have all the answers and can tell you how to
fix yourself in a few simple steps, without the authoritarian tone. In reality, all
these impressions are based on some kernel of truth about the specific interventions that therapists use.
Each of these descriptions is based on a different snapshot of the relevant
content of therapy, and the associated procedures or methods. Therapists have
traditionally identified themselves in one or another of these snapshots on the
basis of their chosen school or system of approach to psychotherapy. Clientcentered therapists are warm facilitators; psychodynamic therapists are intrapsychic interpreters; humanistic therapists are guides for personal discovery
and expression; and cognitive-behavioral therapists are coping skill dispensers.
Decades of accumulated research on the effectiveness of different systems
of psychotherapy have gradually induced a paradigm shift toward understanding the foundations of psychotherapy as a flexible set of procedures applied in
the context of a clinical relationship. Whether clinicians conceptualize psychotherapy as a set of empirically supported treatments designed to ameliorate specific clinical syndromes (e.g., Chambless & Hollon, 1998) or as empirically
supported relationships that are designed to meet the needs of specific persons
(e.g., Norcross, 2002; Wampold, 2001), adherence to a single school of therapy
and one-size-fits-all methods is increasingly outdated. As Norcross notes, “The
research shows an effective psychotherapist is one who employs specific methods, who offers strong relationships, and who customizes both discrete methods and relationship stances to the individual person and condition.”(2002,
p. 13). In essence, we are moving away from an “allegiance” model of practice
where the psychologist makes a categorical decision to adopt a single theoretical orientation and toward a broader scientific model where the psychologist integrates empirical information into a biopsychosocial model of human
behavior. The core units of competence with the biopsychosocial model are the
ability to think critically and to approach clinical phenomena in a systematic
and unbiased manner.
Applying Specific Procedures
As you read about specific procedures, keep in mind that the success of any intervention depends in part on the context in which it is applied. In practice,
both instrumental and interpersonal dimensions are part of the same context,
and have a reciprocal interaction (Safran & Muran, 2000). The usefulness and
potency, for good or ill, of any procedure is highly affected by when and how
the therapist applies it, for what purpose, and how the patient feels about it.
Therapeutic Methods: Building Psychotherapy Skills 283
The procedure may be well tested and useful in a general sense, but not workable in a given clinical situation for any number of reasons. The explanation of
the procedure may be insufficient, it may not suit the learning style of the particular patient, it may be awkward or uncomfortable to either party, or it may
be peripheral to the patient’s current problems, just to name a few possibilities.
Thus, you may find that these potentially effective procedures do not always
work in the straightforward way that our examples suggest.
Effectively using a broad range of procedures requires conceptual and
technical skill, timing, and interpersonal rapport. Stuffing a large number of
techniques into a given client’s therapy will not necessarily lead to better outcome. Overreliance on techniques or over-using a few techniques can make
therapy shallow and gimmicky. Forcing a particular procedure on a reluctant
client is perhaps the riskiest venture because the therapist might be confusing
the procedure with conceptualization, thinking that the essence of therapy is
defined by some prototypic action. The therapist may be caught in a “should”
and “must” trap about techniques of therapy. For example, the therapist might
think that every cognitive therapy session must include an automatic thought
record. There are many risks in this sort of rigidity, including the risk of alienating the client from the opportunity of therapy.
Readers should keep in mind both the interpersonal and clinical context
for any procedure. The following sections describe some of the basic tools with
which the provider can craft a more comprehensive intervention. These are not
intended to be exhaustive summaries, but rather a foundation of procedures for
building basic practice. For the sake of discussion, these procedures are divided
into interpersonal and systems, affective, behavioral, and cognitive categories,
reflecting the primary mode of the intervention. Each category includes descriptions of eight useful intervention procedures. In practice, these interventions are often combined and applied in the context of a collaborative
relationship. Other relevant factors including the principles, stages, and levels
of change are also part of the conceptualization that guides selection of procedures such as those described here.
Interpersonal and Systems Interventions
Interpersonal and systems interventions are geared toward functional
changes in patterns of communication and processes of social and group interactions. Depending on how the client presents for therapy, interventions of
this type may be appropriate early, in the middle, later, or instead of individually focused work. Clients with a chaotic, neglectful, controlling, or otherwise unstable family history may especially need to address the interpersonal
components of their problems. Interpersonal interventions develop skills and
interactions needed for effective functioning within relationships and groups.
For a given client, there may be internal barriers to more effective functioning
such as faulty beliefs or pent-up feelings that need to be addressed with affective and cognitive interventions either before or concomitant with interpersonal changes.
284 Basic Techniques for Clinicians—Intervention
Family and Cultural History
Family processes play a pivotal role in the psychosocial development of individual members. This is especially true for the impact of a family of origin on its
children, as some degree of connection to these family processes is present
throughout an individual’s life span. Family patterns are also embedded within
a cultural context of values, beliefs, and affiliations that shape the norms
within a family for acceptable behavior and expected family functioning (Teyber, 2006).
All approaches to therapy include at least an overview of family and cultural experiences that affected an individual’s child and adolescent development. Most core beliefs and associated behaviors have their origins in these
early experiences. The task of reviewing a family history can take an oral narrative form in therapy sessions or it can be written as a homework assignment
and discussed in the sessions. Yet another option is to illustrate a complete,
cross-generational family history with a formal genogram (McGoldrick, Gerson, & Shellenberger, 1999). The objective in such explorations is to better understand the client’s behavioral and emotional learning history. Hypotheses
can be drawn about the beliefs and conclusions the client formulated concerning the self and other people on the basis of these experiences with significant
others.
Interactions with family may have shaped the personal beliefs “I am
unimportant,” and “other people will reject my needs.” When activated, these
beliefs will likely show up in current interactions discussed in therapy, and in
relating to the therapist. Connecting beliefs to the family history spotlights the
implicit, inflexible and durable nature of these ideas as the basis for a pattern of
relating to the self and the world.
When these beliefs arise during the therapy interaction (e.g., if the client
is overly apologetic about rescheduling an appointment), the therapist can spot
the activation of the core belief and help the client recognize the pattern and
learn to discriminate the past from the present. In addition, the healing process
includes helping the client to realistically understand family events and coalitions and to come to terms with both the good news and the bad news in their
families (Teyber, 2006). Important areas to explore include family economic
and health history, major events, cultural affiliations, affective and behavioral
rules, and the impact of any family secrets.
Case Example
Donna came to therapy because of acute
anxiety problems. Her mother had died
suddenly a few years ago, and ever since
then, Donna has suffered recurrent
panic attacks and depression. Her childhood had been economically, socially,
and geographically unstable, with her
mother as the source of reassurance
during tough times. Her father was a
minister who moved from church to
church, eventually alienating each successive congregation with his stern,
judgmental, and self-centered attitudes.
He made favorable first impressions
Therapeutic Methods: Building Psychotherapy Skills 285
Trace an Interpersonal Developmental Time Line
An overview of the client’s personal developmental time line in terms of interpersonal skills, challenges and resources can refine global self-perceptions and
activate a hopeful perspective. Being in a state of distress often produces memory distortions such that current difficulties are recalled as being continuously
present, and are then projected to either stay just as bad or worsen indefinitely
into the future. The client says, “It’s always been this bad, I’ve been a misfit my
whole life. If I am not any better with my relationships now, how am I ever
going to face the challenges of my future? I’ll certainly fail and be alone forever.” If encouraged to test the accuracy of this thought directly, the client is
most likely to defend the perception as true.
Another way to test the accuracy of this generalization is to go back in time.
For many clients, it may be useful to begin the time line in childhood, perhaps
Case Example (Continued)
with his impassioned approach to religious leadership, but inevitably he
would cross the wrong person and have
to move on to another locale. He was
emotionally distant and punitive with
his children, and he expected most of all
that they should make him look good in
public. The children were strongly admonished not to discuss their father’s
methods of corporal punishment outside
their home, and they were not allowed
to talk back to him. Donna learned “I
must seek the approval of others,” and
“other people are threats to my safety.”
At her mother’s funeral, Donna had
the opportunity to have contact with
her mother’s family, with whom they
had very little communication over the
years. She even met several cousins and
their families for the first time and
found them to be warm and charming.
This did not fit at all with the negative
image of heathen, immoral alcoholabusers that had been offered by her
parents as the reason for the family distance. In talking with her maternal
aunt, Donna discovered the true reason
for their distance had been her own
mother’s shame over her father’s instability and abusive behavior toward the
children and her father’s controlling attitudes about family associations. There
was a history of alcoholism in her
mother’s family, which was the main
reason that her father had discouraged
and even forbidden their contact.
Donna was now redefining her family relationships, including her family
of origin and her extended family of
in-laws. She wanted to be more assertive and increase her contact with
her mother’s family and decrease her
contact with her father, and limit her
interactions with certain in-laws who
seemed to be highly status oriented,
but she found this triggered her global
fears of disapproval. In discussing her
choices with her therapist, it became
evident in their interaction that she
was also seeking the therapist’s endorsement as part of the interpersonal
pattern of her core belief about the
need for approval of her actions.
286 Basic Techniques for Clinicians—Intervention
their preschool years, and inquire about interpersonal functioning in segments of
time proceeding through their development. The perspective gained by this exercise, in addition to a vast wealth of information about their life history, is often
one of ups and downs. At a broad level, the global conclusion that “I’ve always
been a misfit,” is disconfirmed by the historical review. Important information
about functional relationships can be used in planning current options and alternatives (see cognitive interventions).
Take a Current Interpersonal Inventory
People interact within interpersonal circles and social networks. Taking an inventory of current interpersonal relationships provides a systematic way to
focus on these relationships. Important dimensions of these relationships can
then be discussed, such as degree of intimacy, frequency of communication,
power and influence, and connections with specific group affiliations. An adequately populated and functioning social network is needed to satisfy individual emotional needs for companionship and enjoyment. Affiliations with
others also create a social reference group and a means of constructing and
maintaining a social identity. A current inventory can pinpoint gaps and possible deficits as well as areas of tension or conflict. This inventory can begin with
a list of important current relationships as well as more casual contacts or acquaintances, followed by an exploration of potential areas of discomfort, difficulty, and potential change.
Clinical Example
When Jan lamented that she had been
a “reject” her whole life, her therapist
remarked that this was indeed an exceptionally rare problem. Because success and failure are typically coexisting
processes that come and go in everyone’s life, it might be important to understand how Jan could have only
continuous failure. Usually the feelings
of success or failure wax and wane over
time as life tasks are alternately easier
or more difficult.
So to really get a sense of this in any
one particular life, it is useful to trace a
time line with notation of any recognizable successes or failures. They began, in
a systematic way, to trace Jan’s life experiences in segments of 5 years, beginning from birth to age five, when Jan
succeeded in many interpersonal tasks
(forming a place in her family, learning
basic verbal manners such as “please”
and “thank-you,” attended mother’s day
out), but perhaps failed in others (too
afraid of the other children to ride the
bus to school). The time line continued
in this way, traced out on successive
sheets of paper, bringing interpersonal
experiences and skills into the present
day. In the end, many forgotten or unacknowledged successes were brought to
light, and failures were put into perspective, so Jan’s overall conclusions
about her interpersonal skills and value
were less globally negative and failure
oriented.

Explore Roles and Role Transitions
Most people will assume different social roles over the course of a lifetime.
From student to apprentice to friend, relative, coworker, adult, boss, teacher,
parent, spouse, neighbor, classmate, professional or many others, our social
roles have a fundamental impact on our psychological sense of self and worth.
Some of our roles are deeply invested with meaning whereas others may be
considered peripheral or relatively unimportant. Being a parent may be central
for some while roles held for employment are simply jobs that are necessary to
pay the bills. For others, career roles have high priority, but family roles are incidental. Most people strive for some balance of family and career roles as both
are important to their sense of self.
Difficulties with role adjustment are possible targets for therapeutic intervention when psychosocial roles are ambiguous, overloaded, or ill-fitted to the
skills or expectations of the individual. Many role difficulties will emerge during a time of transition, when any discrepancy between the skills and abilities
of the individual and the role demands becomes apparent. This may occur because the person does not fully understand the tasks and demands, does not
have the skills for fulfilling the demands or has become incapacitated by the increasing demands of multiple roles or significantly more complex roles. Discussion of the specific expectations and requirements of the role and the process of
change can help mobilize a more effective coping perspective. When needed,
Clinical Example
Ray was depressed and lonely. He was
estranged from his extended family, his
father was deceased, his mother was in
a nursing home due to severe and progressive dementia, and his only sibling
lived in a distant state and was disabled
by years of alcohol and drug abuse. He
and his wife were separated but not divorced due to religious reasons, and
they rarely spoke. His work as a consultant required regular travel throughout
the country for short-term assignments,
and as a result, he had no work colleagues to speak of. His office was in his
home, where he lived alone. Because of
his work travel, he kept no pets. He no
longer attended church and he belonged
to no groups or associations.
Ray’s interpersonal network had
such a deficit in the number of people
that he was basically interpersonally
impoverished. His social skills for casual interactions were strong, as he had
no problem traveling about and interacting with new people in different
work settings all the time. However, his
skills in making and establishing more
intimate friendships and relationships
that would continue past a fleeting
contact were much more limited. In addition, conflicts and tensions from his
family of origin affected not only the
number of people participating in his
life, but his willingness to risk trust and
intimacy with others.

specific skill development may help with role adjustment. For example, retirement planning classes may help with the shift from full-time professional to
part-time volunteer.
Provide Instruction in Assertive Communication Skills
This intervention involves assisting clients in recognizing and choosing to express their thoughts and feelings in a manner that is conducive to effective social interactions. The focus of the intervention is the behavioral expression of
clients’ underlying feelings in ways that show respect for both self and others.
This intervention has several components. First, the client learns to recognize signs of unassertiveness, such as being too passive and feeling victimized
or disappointed, or signs of being too aggressive, demanding, or inattentive to
Clinical Example
Mark came to therapy at the insistence
of his wife, Renee, who was at her wit’s
end with role overload. She was working full time, taking care of their infant
daughter, and helping Mark’s mother
deal with breast cancer and a failing
business. Mark had completed a college
degree in music education and a master’s degree in educational administration, but he had yet to apply for any
jobs. Instead, he spent his days at home,
smoking pot and playing video games.
Renee took the baby to day-care,
worked all day at an administrative job
she disliked, picked up the baby, and returned home, only to be greeted by
Mark, sitting on the sofa surrounded by
mess, asking “what do you want to do
about dinner?” Mark would then go to
the supermarket, if Renee gave him a
list, although he might get sidetracked
by stopping off to visit with friends
along the way. Mark was comfortable
in his role of extended adolescence, but
was on the verge of failure in fulfilling
the new roles of spouse and father. Part
of Mark’s difficulty was role ambiguity.
He had not given much thought to the
actual changes that were taking place
in his life and thus did not become oriented toward the new roles. He was
still in his mid-20s and he viewed adult
responsibilities as something for his
30s. This was still the time for having
fun, and as long as Renee was working
and they could pay their bills, he did
not see the need to make any changes.
Sometimes role transitions can be
eased by obtaining practical help from
other people, at least until the skills
needed for the new role can be fully developed. Some roles are demanding precisely because there added or more
complex responsibilities. Sometimes delegation to others is unavoidable. The
client may not have attempted to obtain
help because of the effort or expense, because of being unfamiliar or uncomfortable with doing so, or because assistance
was not readily available. Many people
either are in a practical situation where
they do not have ready access to people
as resources, or are in a psychological situation where they avoid this option.
There may be internal cognitive or emotional barriers to this process (e.g., “I
should be able to handle all this myself; I
am failing if I do not.”). However, at a
fundamental practical level, it is important to ask whether the role strain could
be eased by obtaining assistance.

the rights of others. Second, the client practices consideration of the possible
choices for expressing thoughts and feelings in the context of specific situations. Therapists can discuss with the client different ways to assert feelings,
such as refusing an offer, expressing an opinion, or making a request, and practice some actual words or statements to use.
These actions need to be placed in an overall context for effectiveness in a
social situation. For example, refusing an offer from a nervous second-grader
who is trying to sell gift wrap for her school is very different from refusing a
sales pitch from a professional salesperson offering timeshare vacation condominiums. The benefits of assertive communication will likely be greatest when
sufficient consideration of mutual respect (respecting both the rights of self and
the rights of others) and social context is given. Thus, this technique involves
developing skills in recognizing one’s feelings, sizing up the situation, and
choosing a response, as well as finding some effective words and using them in
a respectful way. The essence of assertiveness may rest in the recognition of the
choices available in social situations, and the specific exercise of a choice.
Routines and Rituals
Routines and rituals help to stabilize individual and group systems by ensuring
that crucial tasks are completed. Informal routines of daily habits provide a
structure that gives continuity and a sense of security to ambiguous and repetitive situations.
Encourage the client’s use of routine to stabilize behavior or improve the
efficiency of important tasks. Having a particular sequence of behavior at bedtime can help ensure a restful night of sleep. Getting back to the routines of
Clinical Example
Thirteen-year-old Ian was embarrassed
and angry with his math teacher for habitually mispronouncing his name with
a long vowel sound like “eye,” and teasingly referring to him as the “eye-man.”
Thus far, Ian had said nothing to the
teacher, but he had gotten a detention
for talking in his class and not paying
attention. Ian and his therapist noted
that he was feeling distressed and angry, but his behavior was passive and
indirect, possible signs of unassertiveness. His therapist pointed out that although it might not be easy, Ian did
have the option of sharing his feelings
more directly with the teacher, and
making a request. They considered the
best time to initiate this communication and practiced the specific actions
with a role-play. Ian decided to stay after school and approach his teacher
when there was less likelihood of anyone else being around. He practiced acknowledging possible thoughts and
feelings of the teacher, acknowledging
his own feelings, and making a request.
His intended communication was to
sound something like this: “Mr. Green,
I know you like to make things funny
in class, but I get embarrassed being
called eye-man. I would like it better if
you would use the pronunciation of my
name that my parents use, which is eean. Thanks.”

everyday living with designated times for regular tasks can be stabilizing in the
wake of a traumatic event, or in recovering from a significant loss. From reading the newspaper every morning to exercise on Monday-Wednesday-Friday to
grocery shopping and laundry on Saturday to eating waffles on Sunday, the
regular routine provides consistency and direction. Key to an effectively functioning system, is the ability to adjust routines as needed to meet temporary demands for flexibility.
Formal rituals also serve important emotional functions. Cultural rituals
such as weddings, funerals, graduations, and holiday gatherings create a sanctioned way to acknowledge membership within the group. Participating in such
rituals gives the individual an impetus to focus on the emotional component of
the relationships, to express emotions in a social context, to acknowledge both
change and continuity in relationships and groups and to attach meaning to
specific social commitment.
Attending a funeral of someone who has died usually helps us process our
own feelings of grief, loss, and separation by sharing those feelings with other
loved ones, recognizing the social changes precipitated by the death, and gaining perspective on the importance of friends, family members, or even fond acquaintances. Other more joyful rituals help us and those around us recognize
our movement through life (e.g., graduations, weddings, christenings, birthday
parties) and attach certain emotions and meaning to that movement. The obvious exception to this strategy is the problem of obsessive-compulsive behavior
that involves excessive and senseless rituals that interfere with normal living.
Family and Collateral Meetings
Consultation with family members or significant others can be useful in many
therapeutic contexts. Sometimes the family unit is the focus of treatment and
all sessions involve some combination of family members. Usually one person
is the identified patient and any others present are identified as “collateral” participants. Family consultations are usually actively structured and directed by
the therapist in pursuit of specific goals. Typical goals for collateral consultaClinical Example
Molly felt enduring guilt about having
had an affair with a married man when
she was in college, even after extensive
work with cognitive reframing. Although it had been a long while since she
had participated in religious services, she
was receptive to the idea of attending
services designed for atonement. She decided to attend services with an attitude
of simply participating in the ritual and
being open to whatever might occur. In
reporting back to her therapist, she described a wonderful and liberating experience that crystallized when she read a
particular scriptural passage that she had
not fully noticed in the past. The passage
instructed the reader to turn away from
sin and to live; in reading this, she saw
the intended message as letting go of her
guilt and moving forward with her life.

tions include one or more of the following: gathering information, sharing information among participants, providing psychoeducation, identifying primary
concerns, expressing feelings, improving communication patterns and skills,
communicating about progress and change, facilitating stress management,
conflict resolution or problem solving, and evaluating and stabilizing roles and
emotional involvement.
Balance Autonomy and Relationship/Group Affiliation
Our culture is very heterogeneous with respect to an emphasis on individual
pursuits over social and familial commitments (see Chapter 3). We tend to endorse the freedom to pursue one’s true inner self, yet we still define one another and ourselves through various relationships and memberships. This
freedom can bring confusion or tension regarding a functional balance between personal fulfillment and social connection. Clients may come to therapy
as a result of the stress of such conflicts and need help reconciling their beliefs,
overcoming barriers that stand in the way of their choices, and recognizing behavioral options for personal and interpersonal involvements.
Signs of this imbalance might include feeling controlled by a relationship
or group membership, feeling stretched too thin and having no personal time at
all, not being able to say no to demands or expectations out of a fear of the social consequences, feeling compelled to do things that are personally harmful
or inconsistent with one’s values, becoming alienated from one’s priorities and
personal goals, or feeling alone and disconnected from any sense of belonging
to a community or dissatisfied and searching for something missing. The focus
of this intervention is to help the client see available choices for both making
and limiting interpersonal involvements with the goal of striking a personal
Clinical Example
Eloise’s severe arthritis at age 75 had
advanced to where she required a fulltime caregiver in her home. She was
delighted to have Robin with her each
day to help with dressing, bathing, eating, light correspondence, and outings
such as trips to the doctor and hairstylist. Each night, either Eloise’s husband
or his sister stayed with her in case she
needed any assistance during the night.
Eloise had been in intermittent
therapy for approximately 25 years for
recurrent depression and severe obsessive anxiety. Recently, she was devastated to find out that her husband had
a long-standing intimate relationship
with a younger woman that he was
unwilling to end. When Eloise returned for individual therapy, her therapist included some collateral visits
with Robin and Eloise as part of the
treatment plan. Robin provided information on Eloise’s mood, revealing
clear shifts related to the husband’s
comings and goings, particularly if he
was gone all night. Eloise was able to
express her appreciation to Robin for
her emotional support, and the therapist was able to provide Robin with
guidance and encouragement on managing the emotional and interpersonal
challenges of this situation.
292 Basic Techniques for Clinicians—Intervention
balance that is healthy and functional. Using or developing assertive communication skills may be a part of implementing the choices in this intervention.
The behavioral implications of the client’s choices are to increase, decrease, or redirect selected interpersonal contacts. A client who does not want
to date a drinker would do well to steer clear of bars, nightclubs, and drinking
parties, and seek friendships through nondrinking venues. If a client thinks he
would enjoy more intellectual stimulation from others, enrolling in a class
might make this accessible. If a client would like to meet others with similar
political interests, it might be useful to volunteer for a political campaign.
Affective Interventions
Affective interventions are focused primarily on the experience of emotions
and bodily sensations. Objectives of affective interventions are to increase conscious awareness of the emotional components of an experience or situation, to
reduce avoidance of an affective reaction, to increase the client’s tolerance of
emotional experience, and to assist in the functional use of emotion. The overall goal is to shape the recognition of a range of affective states as a source of
vital information in adaptive living.
Intensity and authenticity are elements of the client’s subjective emotional experience that represent individual differences, and should be respected
Clinical Example
Ryan enjoyed his sales manager position, but the job required a great deal
of entertaining and socializing on the
nights and weekends. These work
events always included alcohol and
there was much heavy drinking by the
sales staff and the customers. Now that
he was married and had a young child,
Ryan wanted to spend more of his
evenings and weekends with his family.
He also wanted to pursue his hobby of
cycling for sport and fitness, but this
was an interest that few of his customers or coworkers shared. He felt as
though he had more bases than he
could reasonably cover and began to
think that his life was not going in the
direction he most desired. The significant financial rewards of his sales job
made Ryan feel successful, and he felt
strong bonds with several of his
coworkers, including the regional manager who was his mentor and “like a father figure.” When he tried to reduce
his contact with the socializing and
drinking, Ryan received much direct
and indirect pressure from his colleagues to maintain the status quo.
Ryan eventually decided that it was in
his best interest to make a career
change altogether. He resigned from his
position, began attending AA (Alcoholics Anonymous) to stop drinking,
and enrolled in a master’s degree program to earn his teaching certificate.

as such. The clinician wants to avoid any implication that there is a “right” or
“proper” type or degree of emotion for any given situation. The expression of
emotion (e.g., anger) may have functional and dysfunctional parameters that
can be addressed with other behavioral, cognitive, or systems interventions.
Mindfulness Practice
There are many strategies of mindfulness practice (see Hanh, 1987; Hayes,
Strosahl, & Wilson, 1999; Linehan, 1993; Segal, Williams, & Teasdale, 2002).
The common thread among these approaches is the focusing of awareness on
internal components of experience and increasing one’s skill in observing perceptions, sensations, and thoughts without attempting to change them. Mindfulness can be done in a quiet, eyes-closed state, or it can be practiced during
an activity such as walking, folding laundry, or eating. This practice often has a
calming effect, although that is not a direct objective. Regular mindfulness
practice is intended to decrease the fusion between problematic thoughts or
emotions and actions, and promote greater awareness of the different dimensions of experience as contents of the mind.
Clinical Example
Betty kept worrying about a family situation that was beyond her control. It was
getting to the point that she barely noticed what she was doing during the day
as her mind focused on the family circumstance. She was instructed in mindfulness practice as a way to help herself
live fully with her experience of worry
and concern. Each day, for 10 minutes,
she would sit in a quiet place and focus
her attention on feeling herself breathing, noticing any bodily sensations as
they occurred, without struggling with
those sensations or trying to get rid of
them. She practiced noticing the content
of her mind, without judging or evaluating it, or pursuing the content in any directed way. She would notice that
worries about her family were popping
into her mind, but she did not attempt
either to get rid of them, or to try to
search for possible solutions. She simply
refocused her attention on breathing
again and again, and would always conclude the exercise with attention to her
breathing.
Emotional Deepening and Validation
Helping clients identify, deepen, or extend their understanding of the emotion,
and accept rather than deny or reject the experience is a fundamental affective
technique. This begins with listening actively for indications of emotional content, and providing reflective feedback to the client. Bringing explicit attention
to the emotional domain, and helping to provide labels for the emotions gives
importance to this dimension of the client’s personal experience, and can help
articulate the experience (see L. S. Greenberg et al., 1993; Linehan, 1993).
294 Basic Techniques for Clinicians—Intervention
Beginning therapists are often prone to underestimate the importance of
this technique and become frustrated with “just listening and not doing anything.” To overcome this error, it is helpful to realize the potential benefit in
skillfully attending to emotional content, appropriately drawing this into the
discussion, encouraging the client to attend to the thoughts and sensations that
are aroused, and providing crucial social support in the form of validating the
understandable triggers of the emotional response.
Clients may have in the past or present encountered those who invalidate
their emotions (“You shouldn’t be depressed; cheer up!”), and they may have
acquired the habit of invalidating their own emotions. Effective listening and
validation by the therapist will often, but not always, help clients reduce their
level of distress, and begin to induce some positive affect as well as a greater receptiveness to problem-solving or suggestion.
Clinical Example
Kay was troubled by family interactions
with her parents. In the following dialogue, the therapist draws emotional
content explicitly into the discussion
and validates Kay’s experience.
Kay: It’s weird when my parents visit.
They’re really a big help with the
kids and all, but they’re so messy,
and they’re always giving me advice
about what my husband should be
doing better.
Therapist: So some conflicting feelings
come up when they visit. It sounds
like you feel happy and grateful for
their help with the kids, but uncomfortable with the unwanted help
with your husband, and the added
stress of more mess in your house.
Kay: (Nods) Uh huh. I don’t want to be
ungrateful, or take advantage of
them, and I do want them to visit,
and have a relationship with the
kids. Oh, I don’t know. I should just
count my blessings and stop griping.
Therapist: Well, we can certainly take
some time to talk about ways to deal
with these feelings that make you
want to gripe. But first, let’s take
time for you to understand those
feelings and have room to have them.
It makes sense to me that you would
feel pulled in two directions given
these circumstances, feeling both
grateful and annoyed at the same
time. Does that describe some of
your experience?
Kay: Yes. I think I’m mainly annoyed
with myself that I can’t just ignore
what they say about Bob and go on.
Therapist: Do you feel that tension inside yourself right now?
Kay: (tearing up) Yes. My throat and
stomach are tight. I just don’t know
how to respond to what they say, so I
just try to blow it off.
Therapist: Well, it seems logical that a
person would feel some tension and
distress when two feelings are conflicting like this, especially when
those feelings are related to such important relationships.
This dialogue would continue with
exploring the client’s feelings and eventually move toward problem solving,
encouraging the client to recognize how
she tends to invalidate and dismiss her
own feelings and modeling an alternative of acceptance via the therapeutic
interaction.
Therapeutic Methods: Building Psychotherapy Skills 295
Interoceptive Exposure
The experience of an affective state may trigger a reaction of fear and avoidance, perhaps because of beliefs related to the unacceptability of certain feelings or their outward expressions, or possible dangerousness of the internal
sensations. Avoiding these internal sensations can lead to broad and elaborate
networks of avoidance and safety behavior.
For lasting change to occur, it may be necessary to work directly on exposure to the actual sensations, to increase tolerance and decrease the sense of associated threat, and to detect any especially problematic thoughts connected to
the sensation. The particular internal sensations feared by the client will be
unique, but are typically associated with an uncomfortable or undesirable outcome, such as choking, collapsing, or dying. Interoceptive exposure involves
activating those sensations, typically in low to medium intensity, to allow for
deconstruction of the sensation in physical terms (e.g., just tension in the muscles) and greater tolerance for the physical experience as well as recognition of
its passing nature, thus decreasing the perceived threat and concomitant fear of
the sensation.
Willingness Exercises
Willingness interventions are exercises of the client’s choice to pursue a desired
activity with the understanding that certain undesired emotions may occur. The
exercise is one of being willing to have the emotion if it occurs, and still carry
on with the plan. So the client might choose to be willing to go to work, even
though depression or a sad mood might occur. Or the client might choose to
give a presentation, even though anxiety might be part of the experience. The
objective of these exercises is to pursue behaviors or activities that are important to the client and give meaning to their life, without trying to control all
emotional components of the experience. The client is practicing the willingness to have emotions.
Clinical Example
When Bob felt panicky, he was especially troubled by tension in his throat,
difficulty in swallowing, and a choking
sensation. These symptoms were explained as due to muscle tension activated by a fear response and not
indicative of any state of medical compromise. Bob had recently been evaluated medically and was deemed to be in
good health. With his therapist’s
prompting, Bob practiced bringing on
the sensations of tension in his throat
and chest. He was instructed to tighten
the muscles in his throat, and then to
stop a swallow half-way through and
hold it for 30 seconds. Then he tightened his chest and held his breath for
45 seconds. This was repeated several
times, each time discussing the degree
of distress Bob felt with the sensations,
noting that his distress went down with
repeated exposures.
296 Basic Techniques for Clinicians—Intervention
Values Assessment
Values exercises bring out the client’s emotional investment in various life activities. Values are pursuits or roles that have an importance for the client that
will typically endure across time and situations. Some values may be more
salient at different times in life, and thus matter more because of developmental demands. Being a good parent may take priority over other important values
when the client is raising young children. An unmarried, childless client may
highly value being a good parent, but other values such as career or friendships
have more immediate salience. We can help clients detect the strength of their
attachment to various values, and connect this to the direction of their energy.
Clinical Example
Shirley prepared a special healthy
snack for her daughter’s first-grade
class and then felt humiliated when the
children did not like it. She was so upset by this personal failure that she was
not willing to have any further contact
with her child’s school or class activities. For a time, she had required her
husband leave work early to pick up
their daughter because she “couldn’t
show her face” at the school.
Being an involved mother was important to her, so she agreed to challenge herself to experience some
undesired emotions to care for her
daughter. First, she returned to school
pickup, and when she did so, she felt an
“anxious rush” while waiting in the car
line. She was instructed to simply ask
herself whether she was willing to have
that feeling, and to encourage willingness. She found the anxious feelings
subsided rather quickly as soon as her
child got in the car. After 2 weeks of
regular pickup, a day of late activity required her to go to the classroom.
Again, she made note of the physical
sensations, including blushing and feeling fearful and slightly nauseous, and
focused on her willingness to have
these feelings in the service of being the
mother she wanted to be. She continued this same exercise of willingness
over and over, until Shirley felt that she
had resumed all her previous activities.
By this time, Shirley was even ready to
try again with a snack for the class
Valentine’s Day party, and was willing
to experience whatever came up in this
endeavor.
Clinical Example
Phillip was in therapy for motivational
problems at work. In exploring his
overall values, Phillip was asked to
close his eyes and imagine his funeral.
In this fantasy exercise, anything was
possible, so he was to select all the people he wanted to attend his funeral, not
just those he thought would attend. He
then imagined selecting someone to
speak about him, and what that person
would say. He then imagined two or
three more people speaking about him, 
Therapeutic Methods: Building Psychotherapy Skills 297
Metaphors
Metaphors offer the opportunity of both a memorable way to present a concept
of change, and an indirect mode of suggestion that may minimize reactance or
resistance. A visually vivid metaphor can create an image that crystallizes an
abstract concept that might be difficult to remember in verbal form. Many clinical metaphors have been developed and tested for use in the clinical approach
of acceptance and commitment therapy (ACT; Hayes et al., 1999). In addition to
using common metaphors, selecting metaphors for change principles can be
guided by the client’s own life experiences and interests.
Clinical Example (Continued)
and what they would say about his actions, his intentions, and his impact on
others. After the fantasy concluded
with some final words about how he
would be missed and remembered,
Phillip and his therapist reviewed his
reactions.
Phillip discovered that he wanted
people to recognize him as a devoted
member of his church and a willing
participant in charitable activities. He
imagined the church filled with dozens
of people who had known him for a
long time, many of whom attested to
his extensive contributions to the community. He also felt that, in the end, his
work success was relatively unimportant, and that his current motivation
issues were probably related to the
greater sense of priority he gave to
charitable activities. This helped him
also recognize that his primary motivation for work was to create stability and
social standing for his family, and not to
produce greater profits for the business.
With a clearer sense of why he was
pursuing his work, he overcame some
of his avoidance and frustration.
Clinical Example
Cathy felt overwhelmed when faced
with important decisions. She struggled
with several dimensions of decision
making, including the fear of making
a mistake, failing to make the right
choice, and feeling uncertain about
her own preferences. She identified a
metaphor that explained how she went
about making decisions, whenever possible, and the degree of certainty that
she perceived was necessary in making
a good decision. When she was small,
she had a favorite book that was entitled, Patty Likes Pink. The story depicted
a child who always knew what she
wanted, confidently choosing pink.
Patty was untroubled by doubt and seldom, if ever, experienced disappointment, because she lived entirely in a
world of pink. For Cathy, the story was
a metaphor for the desire to remove all
doubt, uncertainty, and risk of disappointment, but at the cost of a limited
scope of experience.
298 Basic Techniques for Clinicians—Intervention
Imagery Replacement
Images can be brought under conscious cognitive influence, much the same as
other verbal constructions. In instances where a client lacks positive images, or
tends to recall only negative images, a direct activation of positive or coping images may induce a more positive association or greater willingness to approach a
difficult situation. Positive images can also be used as a distraction technique for
disrupting ruminative thoughts, dwelling on intrusive or negative images, or
coping with a difficult or painful experience. The objective should not be to suppress or avoid the occurrence of any particular thought, but rather to prompt
the access to positive, enjoyable, or coping images. Creating a picture in the
mind activates the positive affect associated with the image.
Clinical Example
Marge, an elder client who was depressed since the death of her spouse,
had frequent visual images and memories of her husband in his sickbed, and
deceased at his funeral. She understood
these images were naturally going to
come into her mind. She did not try to
suppress them as they were part of a
grieving process. However, she was also
encouraged to activate additional images drawn from her memories of the
couple’s happy times together. She recalled the image of them on their wedding day, and some images from their
honeymoon. She remembered images
of the two of them on a camping trip,
holding hands and being close. Marge
found it very pleasant to linger on these
images, and to enjoy in her mind the
sense of being with her spouse and enjoying the soothing warmth of a campfire together.
Expressive Monologue
An expressive monologue is an exercise to help clients articulate feelings that
have been suppressed or unresolved for various reasons. The key element is
that the monologue is directed toward a specific person or group, approximating the experience of clients actually telling the person how they feel.
Sometimes this is referred to as the “empty chair” exercise, because it is
useful to imagine the person present, and to talk as if he or she is listening.
There may be a dialogue component to the exercise as well, where the recipient’s responses are included and a conversation enacted. Expressive monologue
can also be carried out in written form, perhaps as a letter to the designated
person. The letter is primarily for expressive purposes and is not necessarily
going to be sent. The client will choose that after completing the exercise. The
therapist can provide support and encouragement throughout the expression of
feelings.
Therapeutic Methods: Building Psychotherapy Skills 299
Behavioral Interventions
Behavioral interventions focus on concrete actions and responses of the client
with the goal of establishing functional and adaptive patterns of behavior.
Adaptive behavior may be very circumscribed (e.g., to be near dogs) or it may
be very broad (to be a better parent). Behavioral interventions address what
the client does, not just in isolated instances, but repeatedly over time. Often
behavioral interventions help the client acquire new responses and build skills.
Or they may prompt or trigger previously learned responses, generalize those
responses to new situations, or better match the client’s behavior to appropriate
situations.
Adaptive behavior can be acquired through observation, practice and positive reinforcement. Maladaptive behavior can be weakened by developing incompatible alternative behavior. The unit of interest may be fairly small, but is
important in activating or disrupting a chain of other behaviors. When complex
skills are involved, the unit of interest might include several elements, including cognitive elements. Cognitive and behavioral interventions are often intertwined, but are presented separately here for descriptive purposes.
Clinical Example
Ben’s best friend was killed in a hit-andrun car accident while attending graduate school. Given the demands of their
respective busy schedules and living in
different cities, Ben had not been in contact with Matt in a few months. He felt
devastated by the news of Matt’s death
and extremely remorseful over having
been out of touch. Ben’s therapist asked
him to participate in an exercise of expressing his feelings in a conversation
with Matt in the empty chair.
Therapist: Let’s bring Matt into the
room, and allow him to be here to
listen to what you most want to tell
him. Imagine he’s here in this chair
(points), and wants to hear what you
have to say. Go ahead and let him
know what’s in your heart.
Ben: “Matt, you were the best friend I
ever had, and you can only imagine
how much it hurts to lose you. I hate
it that your life ended this way, and if
you have any awareness in the afterlife, I bet you hate it, too. There’s a
great big hole in the place you used to
be . . . especially when I think about
having someone to share things with,
or just help me keep my head on
straight. I know I have other friends,
its true, but none of them will ever be
the friend I grew up with, went to
college with, chased all those girls
with, and had all the good times with.
And had a few rough spots, too. It’s
sad to think there will be no more
good times, no more rough spots, just
memories. Somebody else will have
to be the best man in my wedding,
when it should have been you. But
when the time comes, I’ll be thinking
of you, so you’ll be there. You’ll always be there.”
Define Target Behavior and Monitor Baseline
Clients often come to therapy with vague goals that have no specific behavioral
reference points. If they state that they wish to be able to drive on freeways, or
to get their home in order, these goals imply behavioral objectives, even if more
specification is needed (e.g., which aspects of the home need to be gotten into
order, and what would the desired order look like?). When a client’s stated goal
is “to be less fearful,” or “to find self-confidence,” it is important to explore actions that could be associated with such a state, to provide anchor points and to
begin to translate diffuse objectives into something manageable and specific.
This is the process of creating an operational definition of the goal
in terms of target behaviors. The client can be asked, “What would selfconfidence allow you to do that you are not doing now?” Or perhaps, “What
are some of the things that self-confident people can do?” Or, “If fear didn’t
stand in your way, what would you be doing?” The operational definition
needs to be relevant and meaningful to the client. Using some generic idea of
300 Basic Techniques for Clinicians—Intervention
Clinical Example
Marge, described earlier, came to therapy because she was depressed about
the death of her husband some months
ago, and she had a long history of anxiety and worry. Her stated goal was to
“not be so sad all the time.” The therapist asked Marge to describe what her
life was like before all the sadness.
Marge had always been quite active and
happy, even if she tended to worry and
fret. In recent years, most of her daily
structure had revolved around spending time with her husband who was in
a nursing care facility adjacent to her
assisted-living residence. Since his passing, she was at a loss for what to do
with each day other than to sit around
and be sad all the time.
Marge’s therapist suggested that being
sad following the death of a spouse was
understandable and that some degree of
sadness would likely remain with her,
but it could possibly ebb and flow over
time. The therapist then suggested that
they discuss some activities that she used
to do, with the broad behavioral target
of increasing her overall activity level.
They explored which activities helped
reduce sadness, and which did not. This
helped them set more specific targets for
activities that were valuable to Marge
and extracted her from the inactivity of
sadness. Thus, the operational definition
of her goal was to engage in more activities that brought her positive feelings instead of sadness.
For 2 weeks, Marge kept track of
how many times she ate a meal in the
company of others, either going to the
facility cafeteria, joining in on scheduled outings, making specific plans
with someone, or when a family member came to visit. She noted that she
was happier when she had meals with
others, and tended to be more sad and
“mopey” when she ate alone. In fact,
she tended to skip meals when she had
no companionship. Just keeping track
of this behavior encouraged her to
sign up for a facility-sponsored activity
where a group of residents went out together to a local restaurant.
what a self-confident or less fearful person “should” do would be unlikely to
help the client.
The next step in beginning to change a behavior or class of behavior is to
monitor its frequency and circumstances of occurrence, without any specific attempts to change the behavior yet. Baseline monitoring is extremely helpful for
increasing clients’ awareness of their actions, as well as connections with triggers, associated thoughts, and emotional and social consequences. Baseline
monitoring is usually nonthreatening and a good way to increase the client’s involvement in therapy and movement toward active change.
Greater compliance is likely to be achieved with simple methods of monitoring, such as making a check mark on an index card, or making a note in a
calendar when and if an action occurred. The frequency of a specific thought or
class of thoughts, such as dwelling on a bad test grade, or thinking about a
spouse’s limitations can also be monitored. Infrequent behaviors that the client
wants to increase should be monitored to determine if there is indeed a low frequency. This may be the case, or it may be that the client has a problem with
distorted perceptions or judgment, perhaps the result of a mood disorder. If the
client says that he never or hardly ever gets to exercise, it might be helpful to
use a calendar monitoring exercise activities and to count up the current frequency of occurrence in a week’s time. The process of observation alone may
produce some change, often referred to as “reactivity.” If this occurs, it can be
regarded positively as a sign of the client’s readiness to change as well as ability
to self-regulate behavior through awareness and intention.
Scheduled Activities for Pleasure and Mastery
This intervention involves prompting or scheduling behaviors that are likely to
elicit positive internal experiences. Positive activities might be something commonly regarded as enjoyable (e.g., watching a movie, sitting in the sunshine),
specifically pleasurable to the client (e.g., getting a manicure, hitting golf
balls), or related to a sense of mastery or accomplishment for the client, given
his or her current mood, strengths, and responsibilities (e.g., doing the taxes,
scheduling an appointment, cooking a meal; A. T. Beck et al., 1979). This strategy may be most useful for clients who have clear deficits in positive affect and
a low or insufficient rate of behavior related to either pleasure or mastery.
Options for pleasure and mastery are selected by first generating a list
of possible activities that the client associates with the potential for positive
emotions such as joy, connection, pleasure, accomplishment, achievement,
or the like. It is important that the possible activities are ones that the client
finds acceptable and potentially worthwhile, and does not find demeaning or
immoral.
Generating such a list of options can be a significant task, particularly if
the client has a significant pattern of withdrawal, avoidance, or low emotional
engagement. In their self-help book on self-esteem, C. M. Nezu and Nezu
(2003) describe this task as developing a “joy profile,” and they draw from
three categories of activity—social, productive, and sensory pleasure. Generic
lists such as those offered by Nezu & Nezu can prompt ideas that might be appealing or suitable for a particular individual. Exploring the client’s past for

what a self-confident or less fearful person “should” do would be unlikely to
help the client.
The next step in beginning to change a behavior or class of behavior is to
monitor its frequency and circumstances of occurrence, without any specific attempts to change the behavior yet. Baseline monitoring is extremely helpful for
increasing clients’ awareness of their actions, as well as connections with triggers, associated thoughts, and emotional and social consequences. Baseline
monitoring is usually nonthreatening and a good way to increase the client’s involvement in therapy and movement toward active change.
Greater compliance is likely to be achieved with simple methods of monitoring, such as making a check mark on an index card, or making a note in a
calendar when and if an action occurred. The frequency of a specific thought or
class of thoughts, such as dwelling on a bad test grade, or thinking about a
spouse’s limitations can also be monitored. Infrequent behaviors that the client
wants to increase should be monitored to determine if there is indeed a low frequency. This may be the case, or it may be that the client has a problem with
distorted perceptions or judgment, perhaps the result of a mood disorder. If the
client says that he never or hardly ever gets to exercise, it might be helpful to
use a calendar monitoring exercise activities and to count up the current frequency of occurrence in a week’s time. The process of observation alone may
produce some change, often referred to as “reactivity.” If this occurs, it can be
regarded positively as a sign of the client’s readiness to change as well as ability
to self-regulate behavior through awareness and intention.
Scheduled Activities for Pleasure and Mastery
This intervention involves prompting or scheduling behaviors that are likely to
elicit positive internal experiences. Positive activities might be something commonly regarded as enjoyable (e.g., watching a movie, sitting in the sunshine),
specifically pleasurable to the client (e.g., getting a manicure, hitting golf
balls), or related to a sense of mastery or accomplishment for the client, given
his or her current mood, strengths, and responsibilities (e.g., doing the taxes,
scheduling an appointment, cooking a meal; A. T. Beck et al., 1979). This strategy may be most useful for clients who have clear deficits in positive affect and
a low or insufficient rate of behavior related to either pleasure or mastery.
Options for pleasure and mastery are selected by first generating a list
of possible activities that the client associates with the potential for positive
emotions such as joy, connection, pleasure, accomplishment, achievement,
or the like. It is important that the possible activities are ones that the client
finds acceptable and potentially worthwhile, and does not find demeaning or

lists such as those offered by Nezu & Nezu can prompt ideas that might be appealing or suitable for a particular individual. Exploring the client’s past for
Therapeutic Methods: Building Psychotherapy Skills 301
ideas about activities he or she used to enjoy is another method to detect possible options. Discussion about things the client finds intriguing or views as
“looking like fun” might be another avenue for new but untested options.
The behavioral component of the intervention is to then schedule a time
and place to try something new or to increase the frequency of activities on the
list. A client might designate the weekend as a time for one new pleasant activity such as attending a play or live music performance. The client might also
plan to use her break at work every day rather than skipping it and continuously working. By taking her break, she can increase her contact with pleasant
activities such as walking in the sunshine or visiting the cafeteria to chat with
coworkers.
From a behavioral standpoint, the effort made to engage in some activity
is the most important outcome to monitor. Some activities, such as regular exercise, require persistence through times of “not so much fun” to gain a tangible sense of accomplishment. Other activities, such as browsing the bookstore,
may be more reliably pleasant. Old pleasures may be outgrown, but first clients
must make the effort to find this out. Thus, the emphasis is placed on shaping a
pattern of behavior rather than producing immediate, specific results.
302 Basic Techniques for Clinicians—Intervention
Clinical Example
Lorrie, a divorced mom with two
teenage boys at home, complained that
she felt completely overwhelmed by the
clutter and disorganization in her
home. She worked part-time and had
“plenty” of time to keep up her home.
When she tried to tackle the housework, she felt pangs of anxiety and
guilt about how much there was to do
and how badly she had let things slide.
These feelings would propel her into
her favorite easy chair to “relax” a bit
before getting started. Often, she either
fell asleep, or became caught up in
watching a sequence of television programs. A crisis developed when her air
conditioner failed during an extremely
hot spell of weather. Because her living
room was such a mess, she would not
call a repair person until she at least
cleared a path between the door and
the air-conditioning unit.
Accomplishing this small goal made
Lorrie more determined to work on organizing and cleaning her home, room
by room. Her social constrictions had
become extreme, to the point that she
would not allow her boys to have friends
over because the house was in such bad
shape. Motivated by her sense of
parental responsibility and her own desire to have a more presentable home,
she decided to schedule a weekend blitz
to start the cleanup. She called in a very
close friend to spend the weekend helping with the decluttering project. Together, they cleared out the major spaces
and organized the things that she
needed to keep. Lorrie found the impact
of these changes so pleasant and encouraging that she decided to schedule daily
housekeeping tasks to keep things in order. She also decided to schedule time
for exercise as a way to increase another
desired but difficult activity.
Graduated Tasks
This intervention involves breaking a more complex activity into its component
parts, and encouraging the client to undertake a challenging action by starting
with the easier components. A metaphor that is sometimes helpful in explaining this strategy is to imagine picking fruit from a tree or bush, and to think of
picking the ripest fruit within reach. One might think of picking the “lowest
apples first,” or the “ripest berries off the top.” This often goes hand in hand
with scheduling activities for pleasure and mastery because clients frequently
view a desired activity as too difficult or formidable to undertake as a whole,
especially if it is something new or previously untried. It is typically much easier to make small changes in a graduated manner, than to make large changes
and try to “leap tall buildings in a single bound.”
The following questions are helpful in establishing the graduated tasks:
“What is the first thing that you would want to do to get started?” Or, “What
needs to happen to make it possible to (engage in X)?” From this, a sequential
outline of each action can be developed, breaking things down into greater
detail when the client needs greater assistance because of roadblocks or lack
of clarity.
Therapeutic Methods: Building Psychotherapy Skills 303
Clinical Example
Sandra wanted to invite her family over
for a birthday dinner for her husband,
but she felt overwhelmed and anxious
about “throwing a party.” So she and
her therapist outlined a list of graduated
tasks that broke down this complex idea
of “throwing a party” into specific behavioral components. First, she identified a possible date and time (Sunday
evening, the week of his birthday).
Then she planned the components of
the meal and how she would get them
prepared (purchase prepared lasagna,
make a fresh salad and a cake, ask family members to bring appetizers).
Next, she phoned family members to
invite them and see if they could come.
After that, she purchased the needed
ingredients for the meal. She also purchased a special gift and wrappings as
well as a birthday banner and some
flowers for decorations. The day before
the dinner, she planned to clean up the
house by vacuuming the floor, dusting,
and cleaning the bathroom. On the
cleaning task, it was important to be
specific about what was really feasible
and necessary. Sandra recognized that
she could easily become overwhelmed
if she was not specific about what it
meant to “make the house presentable.” This did not have to include polishing the silver and cleaning the
gutters. On the day of the dinner, she
planned to bake the cake, make the
salad, and put on her favorite dress and
jewelry. The last items on the graduated list of tasks were to remind herself
to use her hostess social skills (when
guests arrive, open the door, smile and
greet them warmly, invite them in),
and to focus her attention on her family
rather than any worries or concerns
that might pop into her head.
Systematic Exposure
This intervention involves assisting the client to confront a difficult, anxietyprovoking situation through repeated or extended contact. Exposure can be
broken down into component parts of maximally tolerable contact, much like
the strategy of graduated tasks. However, the focus in systematic exposure is
the experience and toleration of arousal, and testing specific cognitions related
to that arousal or the stimulus itself. Exposure to one component or level of
arousal may need to be repeated a few or many times before the client is ready
or willing to undertake the next component. In graduated tasks, the components of the overall task tend to flow more readily, one to the next, without
much, if any, repetition.
304 Basic Techniques for Clinicians—Intervention
Clinical Example
Craig, an expectant father, had a fear of
changing a baby’s diaper. He was afraid
that the baby would be uncooperative
and cry, urinate on him, or that he
would become nauseated by stool-filled
diapers, or be unable to wipe the baby’s
bottom and secure the clean diaper effectively. He was quite panicked by this
fear, thinking that it made him a “wimp”
and a baby himself. Both he and his wife
expected him to “suck it up” and be
ready to change diapers for his expected
son. Craig’s therapist started by reassuring him that his reactions were completely understandable, and that these
should get less intense with repeated exposure and familiarity with his baby, but
more difficult with continued avoidance. They began a plan of systematic
exposure using a doll to practice changing and wiping, and increasing the
arousal by having his wife place brown
mustard in the doll’s diaper for him to
change. Next, they arranged a visit to the
newborn nursery where Craig watched
through a window as a nurse changed an
infant’s diaper.
In each of these exposure exercises,
Craig noted his level of arousal on a
scale of 0 to 10, how well he tolerated
that arousal, and whether any of his
fears were confirmed or disconfirmed.
Exposure continued after the arrival of
their son, as Craig first watched the
nurse change the baby, and then his
wife change the baby; finally he tried
changing the baby. At first, he changed
the baby with a dry diaper, then a wet
diaper, then a diaper with stool. He
noted that one of his fears was confirmed (the baby might urinate during
changing), but that it was tolerable and
did not create much arousal. He also
realized that the baby sometimes became fussy during changes, but usually
diaper changing helped the baby calm
down, disconfirming another of his
fears. Finally, he found that although
he was uncomfortable with dirty diapers, the discomfort was tolerable and
became less noticeable over time.
Behavioral Rehearsal and Time Management
Behavioral rehearsal involves practicing or role-playing a behavior or sequence
of behavior to improve the client’s confidence and chances of successfully carrying out the behavior in its normal context. Behavioral rehearsal might include practicing a difficult conversation by role-playing with the therapist. Or it
might involve an imagined practice where the client and therapist verbally describe a sequence of actions, as if they were describing an action scene from a
movie or play.
Sandra, in the clinical example of graduated tasks, behaviorally practiced
her hostess skills by imagining and describing specifically what she would do
during her party. Behavioral rehearsal is a particularly useful tool for building
time management skills, and dealing with the complexity of organizing one’s
behavior in the context of real time.
To begin behavioral rehearsal of time management, discussion can start
with either a designated time to be structured (e.g., weekends), or the activities
that need to be planned (e.g., find time to exercise). The first step is to allocate
time for specific actions. It is important to be specific, denoting real times and
clear, observable behaviors (e.g., walk or cycle from 4:00 to 5:00 P.M. on Tuesday, Thursday, Saturday, and Sunday). Even if the planned action actually takes
place at a different time or in a different form (went to the gym at noon because it was raining and I had a break), the listing of specific times increases behavioral orientation toward action and helps the client move out of wishful
thinking and vague imagining. The client’s own personal calendar can be used
to sketch out a plan and monitor its implementation, or the therapist can provide a simple list of times of the day, with space to fill in the actions.
The next step in rehearsing time management is to establish a realistic
transition time between activities. Allocating time between activities for a
transition is much like leaving a margin on a written page, or creating a frame
around a picture. There is a need for some blank space, to allow our senses to
have a stopping point and some brief rest, to demarcate the lines between
when one thing stops, and another begins. All too often, our time margins are
either quickly gobbled up, or entirely neglected in the interest of heightened
productivity or an ambitious agenda. Without a time margin, there is no room
for dealing with unexpected delays, enjoying a lingering moment, or taking
advantage of a spontaneous idea. A situation may be experienced in very different ways, and perhaps have a different impact or outcome, when there is
sufficient ease in time versus pushing the effort right up to the limits in time.
Clients are much more likely to report a sense of mastery when they can
complete things in the time available, instead of not even coming close to
completing a particular agenda or list of activities. This simple situational
change can precipitate fairly significant changes in the qualitative experience
of an activity.
The final step is to rehearse ways to revise the plan of action should that
be needed along the way. Because so often our estimates of needed time are just
that—estimates—it is not uncommon to find ourselves in the midst of an unworkable agenda. Even with good planning and reasonable margins, something

306 Basic Techniques for Clinicians—Intervention
Clinical Example
Corey, a 35-year-old sales manager, entered therapy with complaints of
chronic stress, the feeling of being overwhelmed, and difficulty in achieving
personal goals. Although he functioned
reasonably well in the context of his
work, he felt that his greater difficulties
were in the domain of his personal life.
On the weekends in particular, he was
frustrated with his “inability to ever get
anything done.” He had aspirations to
exercise more and get together with
friends for a pickup game of basketball,
and he wanted to enjoy time with his
family, have time to check in on his elderly mother, take care of home maintenance tasks, and occasionally get
away to the lake for some fishing.
Instead, his weekends were consumed by a slew of what seemed to be
unending errands and “who knows
what.” On a recent weekend, as he was
on a trip to the drugstore with his
child, he experienced a panic attack.
This terrified him, as it appeared that
his health was now declining as a result
of his ongoing stress, and he sought
both therapy and medical evaluation.
The medical evaluation revealed no abnormalities, and he was encouraged to
begin a regular program of exercise.
Corey’s therapist suggested that they
take his list of desired activities for the
weekend, and discuss some possible
times to designate for specific endeavors. The pickup basketball game was the
easiest place to start, because there already was a group meeting at a nearby
gym at 2 P.M. on Saturdays. Corey could
either just show up with that group, or
arrange to meet friends for a scrimmage. To effectively make this commitment, however, Corey also had to pick a
designated time for his other important
activities, to insert some margin into his
plan, and practice making revisions
while in action when delays or interruptions occurred. He worked up a
short list of home maintenance and
family activities to take place prior to
the basketball game, with a specific
time to stop and shift his attention toward getting to the gym. He then designated Sunday as a flexday, to include
time for visiting his mother and enjoying recreation such as fishing. His therapist encouraged him to practice working
out a plan on paper, so that he could
best create a situation that allowed time
for each thing. His plan looked like this:
Saturday: Breakfast with family
7:00 A.M. to 8:00 A.M.
Mow grass or wash car
8:00 A.M. to 9:30 A.M.
Daughter’s soccer & lunch
10:00 A.M. to 12:00 P.M.
Stop at Home Depot after soccer
Fix toilet
12:30 P.M. to 1:30 P.M.
Leave for gym
1:30 P.M.
Basketball
2:00 P.M. to 4:00 P.M.
Rehearsing the sequence of actions
and writing it down helped Corey practice organizing his behavior in the context of real time. He became more
successful in getting around to what he
wanted and needed to do. He realized
that thinking about everything without
a plan for designated times was immobilizing him from getting much of anything done.
may significantly alter the original plan. Recognizing this has happened and revising the agenda in the midst of action is all part of effective time management.
Stimulus Control
Specific behaviors become more likely to occur in the presence of certain cues
or prompts. Conversely, they can be weakened or made less likely be altering or
removing the cues. Complex patterns of behaviors typically have a recurring
sequence, or chain of action. Each behavior acts as a cue or trigger for the next
action in the sequence. When change is desired, it can be useful to map out the
currently occurring chain, and plan ways to alter this chain to achieve a different outcome. This can be graphically drawn out on a piece of paper or chalkboard, illustrating the typical chain from a logical starting point, noting possible
and likely points to alter the sequential cues. The net result is response prevention, as a highly likely response is prevented from occurring by altering the
chain of action.
Therapeutic Methods: Building Psychotherapy Skills 307
Clinical Example
Brock, a 40-year-old business owner
wanted to decrease the frequency and
amount of his alcohol use and unproductive “screen time” at home in the
evening. After monitoring the baseline
amount of alcohol typically consumed
and time spent on his computer or
watching television, he and his therapist mapped out the typical chain of behaviors that occurred each evening,
beginning when he walked in the door.
First thing, he greeted his dog. Then he
thought about how stressed he felt,
turned on the television, and mixed a
drink. He sat on his sofa, drank the
cocktail and watched the news. When
his glass was empty, he got up and
mixed another drink and returned to
the sofa to watch more TV. After the
second drink was finished, he got up
and microwaved a frozen dinner, ate it,
fed the dog, and then mixed another
drink and went to his computer. He sat
down and read e-mail, sent instant
messages, and surfed chat rooms.
Sometimes he would continue mixing drinks or pouring glasses of wine
and returning to the computer to chat
for several hours, losing count of the
number of drinks or amount of alcohol
consumed. However, the most frequent
behavior chain followed the pattern of
two to four drinks of alcohol, and several hours of screen time. He and his
therapist drew this chain of actions out
on a piece of paper, describing each action in connecting, sequential circles.
With this graphic example to support
their discussion, they reviewed possible
places that he might alter the chain, to
prevent the typical sequence of drinking so much or spending so many hours
in front of a screen.
As part of this plan, Brock specified
measurable behavioral goals: to have
no more than 3 drinks in any one day
and no more than 10 drinks per week
overall, with a target of 0 to 2 drinks
per day and a screen time of no more
than 3 hours of combined computer

Behavioral Relaxation
This technique specifically refers to tension reduction in terms of both cognitive activity and muscle tension. Many techniques are available for assisting
clients to reduce muscular tension, and adjust cognitive tension.
The general procedure is to start with adjusting external sensory stimulation by dimming lights, providing a comfortable chair or recliner, adjusting the
temperature, and reducing intrusive noise (and perhaps including a soothing
sound). The client then focuses on physical sensations, particularly breathing,
and is instructed either to simply release tension throughout different parts of
the body (e.g., let the arms relax, let the shoulders relax, let the face relax), or
to tense and then release different muscle groups (see D. Bernstein &
Borkovec, 1973; Otto, Jones, Craske, & Barlow, 1996). Instructions for cognitive tension release typically include allowing thoughts to occur, but refocusing
attention on physical sensations, or simply relaxing and letting thoughts happen without responding or otherwise attending to them. Relaxing or calming
imagery may be included as part of the exercise, creating visualized places that
the client associates with pleasant, relaxed states, such as floating in a pool, sitting by a fountain, lying on a sofa, or swinging in a hammock. This intervention is useful as a general method for improving well-being, as well as for
disrupting dysfunctional states of overall tension.

Clinical Example (Continued)
and television time. His alternative
plan was to use his evenings more productively for reading, working on his
house, entertaining, or just playing
with his dog.
Brock used behavior monitoring to
keep track of the number of drinks he
consumed each evening, and he rehearsed behavioral changes at very
specific points in the sequence. He decided to greet the dog, and then instead
of mixing the first drink, to take his
dog for a walk and play with him in the
backyard. He also decided to skip
watching the news on a regular basis
before dinner, and to spend more time
actually cooking dinner, something
that he enjoyed. He might choose to
have a glass of wine with his dinner, or
not, but he would postpone having a
mixed drink until after dinner, if he
had one at all.
Over the course of several weeks, he
discussed the challenges and successes
in making these changes in his habitual
evening pattern. This discussion helped
him to rehearse specific, discrete behavior changes as a form of altering
his responses to cues and situations
encountered on a daily basis. Although
the changes may sound relatively
straightforward, considerable effort
and persistence were involved in executing this intervention. However,
Brock significantly reduced his alcohol
consumption, avoided binges of drinking an uncertain quantity of alcohol,
maintained his targeted objective of
moderate alcohol consumption, and increased the quality of his leisure time.
Generalization of Behavior
This intervention involves either prompting or identifying established behaviors
that can be used in new ways, or in new situations for better adaptations. The
focus of the discussion between client and therapist may be on skills, where they
take inventory of the skills used in one situation that may apply to a new or
more challenging situation. This intervention can be particularly useful for
clients who are having some difficulty with a role transition or adjustment.
Therapeutic Methods: Building Psychotherapy Skills 309
Clinical Example
Beth was prone to extreme states of
tension and worry. She had obsessive
worries about her health and her
medications, side effects, allergies, and
interactions among the drugs. She worried about what people thought of her,
and about their reactions to her health
problems. In particular, she worried
about her interactions with health care
professionals, which were numerous
and frequent. In her chronic and sometimes extreme state of worry and tension, she would experience increases in
various side effects and allergies, such
as unusual sensations, itching, rashes,
and sensitivity to foods. Her inclination
was then to worry more in an attempt
to figure out what to do about her reactions. Behavioral relaxation helped her
disrupt this spiraling chain of tension
and worry. She experienced a decrease
in her overall rating of experienced tension in the moment by taking 10 to 20
minutes to systematically tense and release her muscles, focus her attention
on breathing, and imagining napping in
a hammock.
Clinical Example
Mary Jo was thinking of dropping out
of nursing school for fear of being unable to complete her required clinical
practice placement some distance from
her home. She was anxious about driving a stretch of road that included interstate travel over a mountainous region.
The time of year increased her chances
of having to drive in rainy weather,
perhaps in the dark if she had to stay
late. She was also worried about being
able to relate to the patients, many of
whom would be elderly. Her therapist
asked her to think about the specific
skills involved in each of these situations, and whether she had any previous experience to build on. She had
driven extensively on the interstates,
once even traveling halfway across
the country. However, the situation of
driving regularly over a mountain,
sometimes in inclement weather or
conditions of darkness was new to her.
So Mary Jo and her therapist discussed in some detail what skills of interstate driving might generalize to this

Cognitive Interventions
With cognitive interventions, the therapist and client are delving into the content of specific thoughts to alter the functional impact of those thoughts. Cognitions are frequently altered indirectly through the other interpersonal,
affective, and behavioral forms of intervention. The unique element of a specific cognitive intervention is the explicit focus on automatic thoughts, ideas,
assumptions, attitudes, rules, or beliefs, and the direct efforts to reshape or revise those mental objects.
Through a cognitive intervention, mental objects (automatic thoughts, assumptions, beliefs) may be altered in degree of believability, importance, or
flexibility by additional ideas or contexts that were previously not being used or
given value. Cognitive interventions are not designed to delete or control
thoughts, or to insert “right” thoughts for “wrong” thoughts, but rather to create a greater range of choice and pliability in mental alternatives.
Detect and Evaluate Automatic Thoughts
This intervention is a basic and fundamental cognitive strategy (J. Beck, 1995;
Greenberger & Padesky, 1995). Automatic thoughts are an evaluative part of
our ongoing stream of consciousness, occurring spontaneously but potentially
influenced by the current mood state. Under normal circumstances, such as
when a person is not in distress, there is also an automatic reality testing where
the accuracy or utility of thinking is quickly checked. When this critical examination fails, the person experiences emotional distress, which typically leads to
more negative automatic thoughts.
In this intervention, the therapist helps the client learn about automatic
thinking and how to bring negative automatic thoughts into awareness. To do
this, specific situations need to be pinpointed, where the client can discern a
change or shift in emotions. Then, automatic thoughts are distinguished from

Clinical Example (Continued)
new situation, and what additional
skills she might need. She also recognized that darkness and wet weather
were not new conditions, and that she
already had specific skills that could
generalize to a new situation of driving
over a mountain, such as slowing down
in the rain, looking for the outer white
line to follow the road in reduced visibility, not braking suddenly if possible,
and staying in her lane except to pass.
As for relating to her elderly patients, they discussed what experience
she had in relating to elderly people
that she could apply to this new clinical
context. Mary Jo recalled spending
summers with her grandmother, enjoying her interactions with grandmother’s
card-playing group, all of whom were
older people, and family gatherings
with her mother’s family, where six or
more older persons often were present.
This helped her realize that she had
some skills in making small talk or conversation with older persons, and that
she knew how to take an interest in
people, both skills that could generalize
to her placement experience.
both situations, and emotions. The degree of emotion is typically rated on a
subjective scale, such as from 0 to 100, to help the client have greater discrimination of degrees of difference, and to identify the more emotionally provocative automatic thoughts.
The next step in the intervention is to prompt reality checking of the automatic thoughts by using a series of questions or probes that focus on the evidence to verify the thought, the alternative interpretations available, or the
implications to be addressed if the thought contains some truth (see J. Beck,
1995). Cognitive therapists often use a written illustration as they work
through this exercise, using a piece of paper or a whiteboard. In sequential
columns, the basic information is listed: situation, emotions, automatic
thoughts, and the constructed response, which will either be reformulated cognitions or a coping action plan. Emotions that are subsequent to the constructed response may also be listed, to illustrate for the client how their
emotions are affected by cognitive perspective.

Debra was feeling depressed and
lonely, so she decided to phone a close
friend whom she had not seen in a
while. During their brief conversation,
she detected a detached tone in the
friend’s voice, and she thought she
could hear the tapping of a keyboard
in the background, as if her friend was
working on her computer during their
conversation. After hanging up the
phone, she felt more sad, lonely, and
miserable than ever. Her automatic
thought record looked like this:

Sad—80
Lonely—99
Miserable—90
Ella didn’t even want to
bother talking to me. She
must not like me anymore. I have no friends.
I’m a loser and a reject.
I never asked if it was a
bad time for her. Maybe
she had a work deadline.
Just because she was distracted does not mean
that she is no longer my
friend. We’ve been friends
for a long time, and I do
still have other friends. I
can try calling her again
at a better time or maybe
send her an email.
Lonely—60
Hopeful—40
Guided Discovery
Guided discovery involves asking a series of questions in a Socratic style dialogue, to draw out intermediate beliefs or those conditional rules and assumptions that arise from and reinforce distorted core beliefs about the self, others,
and the future. Such assumptions and rules form a web of emotionally charged
cognitions that guide and direct the person’s behavior. These cognitions can be
addressed with the same methods of critical reality testing that are used for automatic thoughts. To do this, the client first must detect the belief and bring it
more fully into conscious awareness, including exploration of the emotions and
behavioral responses that are tied to the rule or assumption. This process of
questioning and exploring provides some important reality testing as such rules
typically operate as a “given,” “just the way things are,” or “the way I was
raised.” This typifies the cognitive rigidity and lack of alternative ideas that the
intervention is designed to address.

they will always be there for you?

for you, that means they are not a
friend?
Debra: I guess so.
Therapist: Is this rule an absolute one,
or are there any exceptions? Could
someone have one or two “strikes”
and still be your friend?
Debra: Well, I suppose so, but I don’t
like it.
Therapist: Have there ever been times
that you were not able to be there
for a friend, but you still felt very
committed to the friendship, and
were able to be there at some point
in the future?
Debra: Oh, never, I’m always a “perfect” friend (laughs). No, really, I see
what you’re getting at. Maybe my
rules for friendship don’t have to be
so strict.
Downward Arrow
This technique follows one particular thought with successive questions about
the attached meaning. By following a trail of associated meaning, the client can
articulate global conclusions that are reference points in the schema for self,
others, and the future. These are the core beliefs that are highly believable,
salient, and persistent over time. The downward arrow exercise helps bring the
idea into the client’s awareness in a verbal form that can be further discussed
and modified.
Generate Options and Alternatives
The client’s upsetting thoughts may be related to situations or circumstances
that are true or unchangeable. The distress is not a function of the client’s distorted view of reality, but rather a constricted view of the possible options for
coping. The client and therapist work together to brainstorm a list of possible
choices, or ideas to try to make a difficult situation more workable. To the extent that the client lacks skills or experience, the options should include a skillbuilding component.

Clinical Example
Bill reported having anxious and depressed feelings after eating lunch with
his coworkers in the office cafeteria.
The topic of conversation had been a
variety of hobbies, and Bill saw his colleagues as being vastly more accomplished than he was. The downward
arrow conversation went as follows:
Bill: I can barely cover my bases on the
job and these guys all excel at work
and accomplish something in their
hobby as well.
Therapist: What do you think that
means?
Bill: They are better than me.
Therapist: Better than you in terms
of . . . ?
Bill: Being a competent human being.
Therapist: If that were true, and I’m not
buying that it is, but if that were
true, what would that mean?
Bill: That I am incompetent and defective.
Therapist: So when you are around
highly competent coworkers, how
much do you believe that you are incompetent and defective?
Bill: Just about 100%.
Therapist: And if it is 100% true that
you are incompetent and defective,
what does that mean?
Bill: I am ultimately a weak person.
Therapist: And does that mean anything
else?
Bill: That I am unlovable and unworthy
of associating with strong people.
Clinical Example
In the previous example of Debra, who
was upset about her friend’s distraction, the therapist helped her generate
some ideas about ways she could respond to this situation. Together, they
made a list of possible options for her to
consider. The list looked something like
this:
• Do nothing. Our friendship has room
for her to be distracted.
• See how things go when we get together next and then decide.
• Call her and vent my feelings.
• Call her and schedule a time to discuss our needs and feelings about
our friendship.
(continued)
Scale on a Continuum
The problem at hand often feels like the worst problem ever because the proximal demands and the level of arousal activate extreme appraisals. Emotional reactions to having the problem can magnify the negative aspects of it, much like
a pebble in one’s shoe can feel like a boulder after a very short distance. This is
especially true if the circumstances are highly salient to self-esteem and the
client has little confidence in being able to cope. Scaling on a continuum recasts
the perspective on the problem; this shrinks back the intensified distress and
decreases the meaning or importance ascribed to a single action or situation.

Clinical Example (Continued)
• Call her to make some plans, but
don’t specifically bring anything up,
just have a friendly contact.
• Write a “Dear Jane” letter to tell her
how angry I am.
• Drop her as a friend. Don’t call or
write, and refuse to answer her correspondence.
Each of these options was discussed
for its possible workability and likely result. Debra decided that she wanted to
try calling Ella to schedule a time for
discussing their mutual needs and feelings about the friendship. She felt this
was most in keeping with her value of
being a loyal friend herself. However,
she was also uncomfortable because she
had little experience with such direct
communication. She was afraid that she
would bungle the conversation or provoke Ella’s anger. So her natural tendency was to avoid confrontation. Thus,
Debra needed assistance in practicing assertive communication skills to help her
overcome the avoidance barrier.
Clinical Example
Shirley made a special effort to prepare a
“healthy” birthday treat for her daughter’s first-grade class. When she checked
back in the afternoon, the snacks were
mostly untouched and the teacher told
her that the children had not been interested in a snack that day. Shirley then
felt “horribly embarrassed,” as if she
could never show her face again at the
school. She was convinced this was a
failure at being a mother.
Prior to using the willingness exercise
described above, Shirley’s therapist used
the cognitive scaling exercise to help her
reduce the intensity of her embarrassment. The therapist asked her to make a
continuum of possible motherhood failures, with a degree of importance attached from 0 to 100% (see the figure
following). They brainstormed a list of
possible failures, from minor importance to major importance by Shirley’s
estimation. The list included failure to
wake your child up on time for school
(25%), failure to check your child’s
homework (40%), failure to check with 
Redirect Attention
When anticipating a challenging activity that provokes some discomfort, the
cognitive response often deteriorates into fruitless rumination. Rather than
evaluating the truthfulness or usefulness of these thoughts, a somewhat different tactic is used. It is already evident that the thoughts are not useful, and
there is little or no dispute of the accuracy of the observations.
Instead, the stream of consciousness produces avoidance behavior, sometimes identified by clients as “procrastination.” It is clear that some important
task or activity is not getting done, and this in turn is creating tension and
worry; and perhaps very real negative consequences are looming. This intervention instructs the client to recognize the unproductive nature of the
thoughts, and redirects attention toward more productive tasks. Tic-Toc is an
acronym for “task-interfering cognitions,” and “task-orienting cognitions”
(Burns, 1989). By labeling the ruminations that accompany procrastination as
“task-interfering,” the debate can be curtailed, and the focus of energy shifted
more directly toward “task-orienting” thoughts.

your child from known dangers or

context of this continuum, the disturbing situation of the failure of her snack
to delight the class seemed much
smaller and less important, rating in the
end, only 15%.

Clinical Example
Moritza, a high school senior, kept
putting off the work of completing college applications. She would sit down
at her computer and think, “I don’t
know where to start. There’s too much
to do. I can do it later. I don’t feel like
doing it now. Besides, I don’t know
where I want to go to college, or if I
will be accepted.” It was no surprise
that she typically would find something else to do instead of working on
the applications. However, her parents
and school counselor were beginning
to come up with more nagging questions about her progress, which further made her think “Everyone is
getting mad at me. I’m probably not
college material.”
(continued)
Assign a Realistic Probability
Once an idea or a possibility is present in our mind, emotions often follow the
possibility, even if it is extremely remote or unlikely. If you think of a terrible
catastrophe, you are likely to feel some sadness and anxiety at the mere thought
or image. This reaction may then build in a cumulative fashion, much like an
avalanche cascading down a mountain, getting larger and larger as more catastrophic thoughts and images are easily brought to mind.
Stopping this avalanche may take a systematic effort of assigning realistic
probabilities to the ideas and images. Sometimes just stopping to think about

Clinical Example (Continued)
Moritza’s therapist explained that
there was an important and specific
task at hand, and it appeared that
Moritza was having a lot of TICs when
she needed more TOCs. This aroused
her curiosity, and the therapist explained that TOCs were “task orienting
cognitions,” or thoughts that would
help her get focused and directed on actually getting something done. TICs
only interfered with her getting the
task done. So her therapist offered
some examples of TOCs, including “I
can start anywhere, it’s okay, just as
long as I get started. It will be simple to
just fill out the name and address parts.
If I run into a snag, the counselor or my
mom will help me. I need to get started
now, even though I don’t feel like it.
And I won’t know where I can go until
I apply and get accepted. The first thing
to do is just open the file with the application form and start filling in the
blanks.”
Clinical Example
Alice developed a fear of being bitten
by a dog after she was randomly bitten
by a pet walking with his owners. Her
experience told her that being bitten
was possible, and now every dog she
saw carried the potential to harm her.
The notion of experience salience was
explained to Alice (having had an experience leads us to think it is likely to
happen again). Then she was asked to
place this experience in a context of realistic probability.
As homework, Alice gathered more
information from dog-training experts
and learned that many factors can increase or decrease the probability of a
dog biting her. These could include the
dog’s breed, the dog’s history of care
(which would likely be unknown to
her), as well as the dog’s behavior at the
time of contact with her, and the place
of contact (whether she was in the
dog’s “territory”). Signals such as
growling, staring, flattening of the ears
and fierce barking would typically precede more aggressive behavior. Any
and all of these factors could help her
determine a realistic probability of a
dog being aggressive toward her, and
help her to plan an appropriate response rather than simply guarding
herself against any contact with dogs
whatsoever.
the realistic probability will easily bring the concept of remoteness to mind, and
help the person realize the minimal likelihood of the apprehension. Other
times, specific testing of ideas or gathering of information is needed to create a
semblance of a realistic probability. If the client does not immediately have a
sense of realistic probability, then further information may be needed to form
a realistic judgment.
Conduct a Survey
A useful way to introduce flexibility into the client’s thinking is to encourage
informal surveys of the thoughts, beliefs, and practices of others. This can help
the client reduce a fear (e.g., “would you laugh and ridicule someone who
passed out in public?”), gain greater confidence in their own convictions (e.g.,
“would you disapprove of a 14-year-old being allowed to smoke pot?”), or normalize common reactions (“do you ever worry about doing well enough at
your job?”).
It is important to discuss who will be the respondents to the survey, as this
will provide a context for the information gathered. For example, a drug dealer
just might approve of the 14-year-old smoking pot. Gathering information,
considering the sources, and deciding whether to revise one’s own beliefs on
the basis of this information are the essential ingredients for increasing flexibility and ability to think critically about one’s perceptions and beliefs.
Therapeutic Methods: Building Psychotherapy Skills 317
Clinical Example
Fritz, an assistant professor, was discouraged and embarrassed that his first
submission of a research grant request
had been rejected. This provoked significant doubts about his ability to succeed in his chosen field, and he began
ruminating about ending up as a barista
at the coffee shop. Conducting a survey
on the typical frequency of this sort of
outcome among colleagues in his current department felt too threatening to
him, but he was willing to contact some
of his mentors to inquire about their
early career experiences. He was surprised to learn that virtually all of them
considered this “par for the course,”
and thought that he had understood
this because it was so common. About
this time, he also attended a national
conference where there was a panel
discussion on early career development, and inquiry of the conference
panelists revealed the same response—
with only one exception, everyone else
had the same experience.
Summary
Effective therapists do many different things, and have many tools at their disposal as the preceding examples show. One thing that we hope they will all do
is remain sensitive to the needs of the client and choose wisely from the vast
array of technical interventions. Having a broad repertoire of technical skills
from which to select options is an important foundation for competent clinical
practice (see Table 11.1).
318
Table 11.1 Common Clinical Procedures
Interpersonal and System Interventions
Family and cultural history: Summarize the members and cultural affiliations of the family. Major
events and the impact of any secrets can be assessed, as well as learned rules and patterns of
behavior. Develop a realistic picture of strengths and limitations.
Interpersonal developmental time line: Review personal developmental history to refine global
self-perceptions of interpersonal skills and experiences.
Current interpersonal inventory: Note the network of current relationships with relevant dimensions such as degree of intimacy, frequency of communication, power and control, and connections to group affiliations.
Roles and role transitions: Spotlight the psychosocial roles of the client and the associated expectations, demands, and opportunities, and explore any transitions between roles or changes within
a role.
Routines and rituals: Encourage individual and group routines and special rituals, often culturally sanctioned, to induce organization and stability, and provide opportunity for emotional
expression.
Assertive communication skills: Practice when and how to express personal thoughts and feelings
to maintain effective and respectful interpersonal relationships.
Family and collateral meetings: Designate group meeting to facilitate communication and effective
role functioning for members of a system. Discussion might include exchange of information;
assessment of primary concerns and progress issues; expression of feelings; and efforts to resolve
specific problems, conflicts, or current stresses.
Balance autonomy and affiliation: Review adaptive choices to meet individual needs for autonomy and involvement in relationships, groups, and communities.
Affective Interventions
Mindfulness practice: Focus awareness on internal components of experience and observation
without judgment or change.
Emotional deepening and validation: Attend, label, and explore emotions in a context of interpersonal understanding and acceptance.
Interoceptive exposure: Activate uncomfortable body sensations systematically to reduce avoidance
and fear, produce habituation, and detect associated cognitions.
Willingness exercises: Release control attempts over emotional components of an experience to facilitate functional behavior.
Values assessment: Detect emotional investment in broad life objectives.
Metaphors: Describe vivid images that illustrate concepts of change in a memorable and emotionally nonthreatening way.
Imagery replacement: Construct pleasant images to prompt positive affect and more functional
coping response.
Expressive monologue: Facilitate articulation of thoughts and feelings in relationship to past events
or absent persons.
319
Table 11.1 (Continued)
Behavioral Interventions
Define target behavior and monitor baseline: Translate abstract intentions such as being happier or
more confident into an operational definition of specific target behaviors that are relevant and
meaningful. Track or monitor frequency and details of a target behavior or class of behavior prior
to any specific attempts to change.
Activities for mastery and pleasure: Schedule activities to provide general activation and increase
likelihood of contact with positive experiences such as pleasure or mastery. Increase understanding of the relationship between mood and behavior.
Graduated tasks: Break a complex activity into manageable components.
Systematic exposure: Confront an avoided, feared stimulus through repeated contact of increasing
proximity or intensity.
Behavioral rehearsal and time management: Practice specific steps as a successive approximation
toward desired skill or outcome. Apply the rehearsal of behavior in a real-time context.
Stimulus control: Increase or decrease the likelihood of a behavior or sequence of behavior by
altering associated cues.
Behavioral relaxation: Use systematic tension reduction to disrupt and reduce physical and
mental stress.
Generalization of behavior: Transport an established behavior or skill into a new or more challenging situation.
Cognitive Interventions
Detect automatic thoughts and evaluate the evidence: Increase awareness and reality checking of
spontaneous cognitions, especially evaluative thoughts.
Guided discovery: Ask a series of questions to draw out a collection of intermediate beliefs or
conditional rules that reinforce distorted core beliefs.
Downward arrow: Ask a series of questions to trace a specific thought back to a distorted core
belief.
Generate options and alternatives: Brainstorm a range of possibilities for coping or construing a
problem to reduce tension, increase flexibility, and foster hope.
Scale on a continuum: Recast perspective on a problem by placing in a context such as a scale of
0% to 100%.
Redirect attention: Label rumination as unproductive thought and redirect or orient the focus of
cognitive attention toward a productive task.
Assign realistic probability: Reality check predictions against actual possibility and gather further
information if needed.
Conduct a survey: Assess potential social consensus for a perception or belief.


Understanding, Facilitating, and
Evaluating Change
The overall purpose of any therapeutic intervention is to foster change that
improves the client’s life in some way. To accomplish this purpose, the clinician must understand the complexities of bringing about change, how to
track and measure change, how to communicate key information about change
as it is happening, and how to maintain change over time.
Learning Objectives
At the end of this chapter, the reader should be able to:
• Recognize four principles of therapeutic change based on the general
principle of patient autonomy.
• Understand motivation to change as a process involving identifiable
stages.
• Recognize clinical indications of five established stages and five proposed
stages in the process of change.
• Explain key barriers to measuring change and practical strategies for overcoming them.
• Discern professionally sound ways to communicate about change with patients, care managers, and other involved parties.
Think for a moment about a personal change that you have attempted
some time in your life. Perhaps you decided to lose weight or to improve your
physical fitness, your social life, your academic performance, or the tidiness of
your personal space. What motivated you to attempt this change? Did you


achieve your desired results? What sort of steps did you take to accomplish
your goals? How much energy and effort did the change require? Did you go
through repeated attempts to change? How did you measure or evaluate your
changes? Did others notice the change? Could you maintain the change over
time? If you did not achieve the results you wanted (maybe you are still trying),
what do you think stood in your way?
The most substantive part of therapy is the middle part, where the bulk of
the work of change takes place. This is sometimes referred to as the “working
through” phase of therapy. The ideas and goals that have been established in
the treatment plan are now pursued in a systematic fashion and progress is
made. Objectives for this phase of therapeutic intervention include keeping the
treatment focused, incorporating new information as it becomes available, eliciting productive change, evaluating progress, and communicating effectively
with all relevant parties. Tools that help therapists effectively navigate the middle phase of treatment include an awareness of principles and stages of change,
understanding the processes that are relevant to each stage of change, and
knowing ways to adjust interventions to the stage of change. Efficient interventions, whether they are brief or extended, depend on doing the right things at
the right time and involving the right people and circumstances to support the
process of change (Prochaska, DiClemente, & Norcross, 1992). Clinicians will
also find it important to apply their assessment skills to measure change as the
patient progresses through therapy. In addition, ongoing communications
about change are an important part of the substantive work of therapy.
Understanding Change
Many patients come to therapy in pain from intrapsychic or interpersonal problems. They want relief as quickly as possible. These patients (and often their
therapist) see the need and the possibility for the psychotherapeutic collaboration to immediately move toward change. This is especially true in the “shortterm” or “time-limited” therapies as opposed to traditional long-term therapies.
In the brief therapy models, the pressure of time limits often compel the therapist to use a more technical-mechanical approach to try to quickly move patients to change before the necessary base for change has been built. The
therapist may, in effect, try to have patients run before they have learned to
crawl and walk. Realistic expectations reflect an appreciation of the complexity
of change as a process. Occasionally, change takes place in a fast and direct
fashion. More often, change is circuitous, following a path of starts and interruptions, new problems, redirections, and unanticipated challenges (Prochaska
& Norcross, 2003). Rather than being a discrete occurrence, change happens
through both internal and external events accruing over time. How much time
is needed will depend on the patient, the nature of the problems and the resources that are available to support and encourage the desired changes.
The tools of collaboration discussed in Chapter 10 are directly related to
the process of change. Here we discuss specific tools related to change that enable the therapist to effectively manage the collaborative relationship and the
Understanding, Facilitating, and Evaluating Change 323
therapeutic endeavor. As the consulting professional, a therapist can reasonably
be expected to have a good understanding of how change usually occurs, and
can facilitate the patient’s understanding of change as a process that may not be
linear or simple to execute. Even when rapport and general understanding between patient and therapist are excellent, a lack of understanding of change or
miscommunications about change can foil the productivity of the therapy. An
effective understanding of change processes enables the clinician to keep therapy moving along in a beneficial direction.
The Principles of Change
The first tool for successfully navigating the change process is to understand
that there are certain principles of therapeutic change (Kleinke, 1994). These
include the assertions that (1) the patient is the agent of change; (2) the agent
(patient) determines the pace of change; (3) action is required for change to
occur; (4) change involves emotional risk.
The Patient Is the Agent of Change
Beginning therapists, and some experienced hands as well, may approach an
intervention by thinking of the changes they will “get” their patient to make.
The therapist has a direct plan in mind and, sleeves rolled up, is ready to get
going. The therapist sees a need to “make” the patient be more flexible, to
make more effort at work, to confront anxiety-provoking situations, or enjoy
more of life. The treatment plan may be sound in terms of overall goals and
objectives, yet flawed in terms of identifying the agent of change. By thinking
of what the patient must be persuaded to do, the therapist is reaching over a
boundary and taking on the role of agent of change. In a sense, the effort of
the therapist and the patient’s behavior are viewed in a way that fuses the responsibility for action. This can create an unhelpful struggle for control of
whatever change will or should occur. Often, such a control struggle will lead
to frustration for one or both parties, and the therapeutic collaboration can
suffer or disintegrate. Therapists may believe that their competence and reputation are at stake if patients cannot be “gotten” to make expected changes in
a timely manner.
This potential control struggle can be averted by recognizing that the patient is the agent of change, and the therapist is the agent of facilitation, encouragement, and support. Any change that happens will be a function of the
patient’s doing. The choice to take action belongs to the patient, even if therapists do not fully appreciate this reality. Recognizing the patient’s ultimate
agency in the change process can open up many more possibilities for helping
the patient align wishes, intentions, and actions. Just because the patient is the
agent of change does not mean that he or she is immediately ready to take action, that action will be easy, or that change will occur if the therapist works
hard enough. In helping the patient to become a more effective agent of change,
the therapist may address several issues, including setting functional expectations for what or who can change, progressing through stages of change, developing a sensitivity to small increments of change, and clarifying boundaries
with others concerning desired or expected changes.
324 Basic Techniques for Clinicians—Intervention
Both patients and therapists may hold implicit assumptions about the
therapist being the primary agent of change, thus compromising patients’
agency in their own lives. These patients may have a long history of struggling
with change and feel ineffective or incapable as their own agents. Such demoralization makes it even more likely that patients will struggle with directive efforts offered by therapists. Patients who are longing for relief from struggle seek
strong therapists who offer the latest, most powerful technology. At the same
time, these patients may remain in a passive mode, waiting for things to somehow change as a function of going to therapy or taking medication, or seeking a
perfect intellectual understanding that will circumvent the potential for failed
efforts. Commitment to the autonomy of patients and understanding of change
processes and relevant techniques for facilitating movement toward change can
keep the therapy focused in relevant ways, and help patients tap their internal
capacity for change.
The Patient Determines the Pace of Change
It may be safe to assume that most if not all patients would prefer quick results.
Can you imagine anyone really preferring the alternative of delayed or slow results, if a choice is possible? However, it is not safe to assume that most patients
are ready or able to change at a rapid pace. Some can change quickly, some not.
This pace is determined by a number of factors, the largest being the patient
him or herself. As much as 55% of the patient’s improvement in psychotherapy
may be attributable to aspects particular to the patient such as his or her expectations, prior skills, and life circumstances (Lambert & Barley, 2002). The therapist can most influence the patient’s pace by facilitating progress through the
identifiable stages of change to be discussed.
Historically, it has been assumed that no patient could quickly change and
that rapid change could only represent a superficial and incomplete resolution
of underlying conflicts. Accelerated results were merely a transitory illusion of
change that would soon be followed by new symptoms, commonly referred to
as “symptom substitution.” If depressed patients experienced a notable mood
shift in a positive direction early in treatment, the symptom substitution theory
predicted that they would soon develop new problems, perhaps compulsive
eating or panic attacks. The new problems developed because underlying conflicts had not yet had time to be discovered and resolved; thus the patients
lacked true readiness to change. New or substitute symptoms were still needed
to express the unresolved conflict. We now have evidence that many forms of
brief, focused therapy provide effective symptom remission and sustained effects over time (Chambless et al., 1998).
It is risky to overgeneralize the positive results of brief interventions to assume that anyone can quickly execute significant changes. The notable benefits
obtained in studies of short-term interventions may contribute to an assumption that is probably just as faulty as inevitable symptom substitution. This opposing assumption is that all change will occur rapidly, and that anything
beyond very brief therapy is unnecessary. Both assumptions impose a time
frame on the patient, and do not account for the patient’s agency in setting the
pace of change, as well as differential readiness for the action of change and
complexity of the overall change needed.
Understanding, Facilitating, and Evaluating Change 325
The challenge is to more precisely discern what factors most influence
the pace of change in therapy. We have some basic understanding of which
patient factors facilitate or impede the pace of change. Factors associated with
positive change include an active involvement in the treatment process, a
positive expectation for change through therapy, and social support for the
desired change. Factors that may impede change include the severity and
chronicity of the problems, lack of social support, the presence of secondary
gain or benefits associated with the symptoms, hopelessness or pessimism
about the possibility of change, and a passive or disengaged attitude about the
process of change.
Action Is Required for Change to Occur
In many areas of health care, being a patient means following the directions of
an authoritative caregiver. When the treatment objective is something concrete,
such as the removal of a tumor, the provider gives explicit instructions for the
preparations that the patient is expected to make (e.g., must arrive on time for
a scheduled surgery having restricted all intakes of food and fluids for a prescribed period). At this point, the professionals take over the action of change
and expertly administer the necessary medications and procedures. The patient
cooperates and consents to the procedures, but may even be unconscious during most of this treatment. When the procedure is complete, the patient must
resume an active role of attending to the matters of physical recovery.
Psychotherapy is a different sort of service, as the patient, being the
agent of change, is the one who needs to take charge of the action for any
change to occur. Just showing up physically for therapy is an important part
of the process, but alone this action is not likely to cause any notable change.
Defining the action that must take place is a bit of a challenge. Just talking or
developing insights does not necessarily lead to behavior change (Kleinke,
1994; Yalom, 1980). At the same time, just executing some action may not
produce needed or lasting change either. Doing things randomly and reactively
may be a fundamental part of the problem. Sometimes the change needed is a
reduction in harmful actions, such as cutting, purging, or using drugs. Here
the action needed is not just to “do something,” but to learn a more subtle
process of responding differently to internal states and perhaps better mastering the impulse to action. Changes in verbal behavior are often an important
part of this change, as patients move away from reciting reasons for maladaptive behavior and toward discussion of alternatives, priorities, and direction of
action. The changes in verbal behavior then pave the way toward strategic
choices in actions.
Change Involves Emotional Risk
What if you encourage a patient to embrace the challenge of change, and his
fears are confirmed? What if you role-play to the best of your ability the skills
of assertive communication and instead of getting the requested raise, the patient gets fired from his job? What happens if you encourage the shy coed to go
out for sorority rush, and she finds herself shunned? What if your patient finally gives up drinking and discovers a deep unhappiness with most aspects of
his life?
326 Basic Techniques for Clinicians—Intervention
It may be that both patient and therapist expect effective treatment to prevent any undesirable feelings or events. This reflects an underlying assumption
that the purpose of therapy is to master or control emotions and situations. The
mastery approach maintains that if the patient is sufficiently rehearsed in the
winning strategies, potentially difficult experiences will not happen. Yes, we all
want our patients to get positive results, and we will help them acquire the
needed skills and make calculated judgments in what they attempt. But we
cannot control outcomes, and we especially cannot control the emotional experience that will take place as the patient undertakes new experiences. The assumption of this latter approach is that of a coping model for therapy. Under this
model, the purpose of therapy is to expand the patient’s range of coping with
difficult emotions or situations, and to make purposeful choices.
The risk associated with change appears to be the risk of having to experience negative emotions such as embarrassment, anxiety, disappointment, or
the stress of inadequately developed skills. Old problems may have developed
as a compensation for even older problems, and when the former is removed,
the latter may be revealed. Emotions encountered within the process of change
may not all be as wonderful as the thrill of success.
Many people assume that the emotional risks of change constitute a negative experience, characterized as painful, frightening, and requiring great
courage (Kleinke, 1994). A broader assumption is at work here, the assumption
that experiencing a range of emotions is inherently an adverse event. At least
some of the emotional risk associated with change may be the threat of unwanted emotions, thoughts, or outcomes. Emphasizing the aversive quality of
consequences that may in fact be uncontrollable usually leads to control efforts, including impulsive or avoidant behaviors. Change involves the risk of
encountering different feelings and experiences, and that is precisely why
change is sought. This risk does not have to be labeled as “bad” even if it is uncomfortable or taxing. A person might feel frustrated, discouraged, or uncertain and yet not consider any of these emotions as particularly painful or
frightening. Our therapy strategies can teach patients that it is possible to manage and redefine such risk in the pursuit of important goals. Coping well often
means understanding, accepting, and managing a full spectrum of emotions.
A sports analogy illustrates this willingness to risk a range of thoughts,
emotions, and experiences. Although all athletes would rather win than lose, no
athlete has risen to the top of his or her sport by being unwilling to take the risk
of losing. The player does not choose to play the game to feel frustrated with personal limits, embarrassed over mistakes, tired and anxious about tedious practice, or disappointed in losing to a rival team, but is willing to risk all these in the
pursuit of higher performance. There is risk of emotional, cognitive, and physical
discomfort, yet it is understood as a functional part of a desired objective.
Motivation and Stages of Change
There is an old joke that asks, “How many therapists does it take to change a
lightbulb?” The answer is, “Only one, but the lightbulb has to want to change.”
In this section, we discuss the dimensional aspects of patient motivation within
the construct of progressive stages of change. Whether short-term or timeunlimited, therapy occurs in a series of developmental stages. These stages, like
Understanding, Facilitating, and Evaluating Change 327
life, are regular, identifiable, and predictable. For some patients change can be
implemented more quickly than for other patients. For some patients there
needs to be a greater focus in the therapy on the preparation for change before
the change can occur.
The issue of motivation to change has long been recognized as crucial to
successful therapy. Some highly motivated patients embrace change more
quickly than other patients do and are apt to have a successful therapy experience. For other patients, change seems to progress at a glacial pace, if it happens
at all, and their motivation appears to be low. The question of what precise factors mediate this varying level of motivation has hovered in the field of intervention for decades. However, a simple motivational continuum from low to high
has yielded little in the way of understanding how patient motivation works.
An alternative approach that conceptualizes patient motivation to change
as a process with identifiable stages has been gaining scientific support over the
past few decades. The application of a stage concept to the process of change has
had a tremendous impact on our understanding of this crucial variable. Most
well known in the area of stages-of-change is the work of Prochaska and DiClemente (Prochaska & DiClemente, 1982, 1983, 1985, 1992; Prochaska et al.,
1992). Originally derived from empirical research with patients in smokingcessation treatment, this transtheoretical model has shown tremendous usefulness in understanding the process of change among patients dealing with addictions and other problematic behaviors. Variations of Prochaska and DiClemente’s
model can also be found in the writings of Brownell, Marlatt, Lichtenstein, and
Wilson (1986), Dryden (1986), and Marlatt and Gordon (1985). There are five
stages in the Prochaska et al. (1992) model of motivation to change: (1) precontemplation; (2) contemplation; (3) preparation; (4) action; and (5) maintenance.
Freeman and Dolan (2001) have expanded on the Prochaska and DiClemente model with an additional five stages that detail important clinical
challenges that may be encountered in the precontemplation and maintenance
stages (see Table 12.1). In breaking down the earlier stages, Freeman and

Dolan’s expansion articulates different cognitive perspectives that may precede
attempts to change, each requiring a different therapeutic response. Similarly,
the failure to sustain change can be broken down into distinct stages and dealt
with according to the specific issues. Armed with this detailed perspective, the
therapist can more precisely assess the patient’s progress in developing the necessary motivation to move through the stages of change. Progress does not typically occur in a finite and direct path. The change process is more of a spiral
through the stages than a straight line toward a cure. Each of these stages may
be visited repeatedly throughout therapy, perhaps even in a single session.
However, not every patient will experience every stage of the expanded version
of the stages of change. For example, not everyone will progress through anticontemplation or relapse.
Noncontemplation
Noncontemplation is the stage of change in which an individual is not considering or even thinking about changing. Those in noncontemplation seem oblivious to a need to change, the effect that their behavior has on others, or the fact
that their global level of functioning is considerably less than it might be if they
were more attentive or cognizant of the need to change. Noncontemplators
simply do not make a connection between their behavior and a negative situation until it is pointed out to them. They are, in a word, clueless.
Patients at this point are not actively avoiding, resisting, or opposing
change. They simply have not considered it, and may be willing to work on
change when it is made manifest or obvious by the therapist. The key statements by the patient are “I didn’t realize that I need to change.” In the noncontemplative stage, patients may enter treatment because of a circumstantial
issue and not necessarily for personal reasons. They may or may not be willing
to consider or think about their own problems, depending on the perceived relevance to the presenting concern.
Case Example
Brenda brought her 11-year-old daughter to a school performance clinic for
evaluation of excessive anxiety related
to homework and tests. As part of the
assessment, Brenda was asked about
how she assisted her child with homework. She reported a lengthy and detailed approach of carefully monitoring
all assignments, sitting beside her child
to actively participate in the completion
of “our” homework, drilling her child
in areas of perceived weakness, coaching her with extensive lectures on the
importance of academic achievement,
and providing workbooks for supplemental practice to assist her daughter
in excelling to her highest level. Brenda
believed her own behavior was part of
a solution, and never thought of it as
part of the problem until it was suggested that perhaps she might consider
whether some of these actions induced
the child’s anxiety.
Understanding, Facilitating, and Evaluating Change 329
Anticontemplation
Anticontemplation is an active process of distinct opposition to the idea of personal change where problems are adamantly attributed to external sources. The
emotional tone of this process may vary, from outright hostility or aggressively
righteous indignation to smug condescension. Whatever the emotional tone,
the essence of this response is a strong reaction to the notion of a need for personal change. Either overtly or covertly, the patient tells the messenger, “Screw
you! I do not need or want to change.”
Those who try to reason with the anticontemplator or to tell him about
the impact of his behavior will be told, “You’re crazy; You’re overreacting; It’s
really your problem, not mine. You’re imagining things, as no one else thinks
this is a problem.” Much time may be spent in complaining about unfairness
and others who are really to blame for any obvious problems. Individuals who
enter therapy in this stage are most often there due to duress, mandated by the
court or pushed into therapy by family or significant others. They will typically
spend the therapy time soliciting validation of their perspective, blaming others,
or otherwise complaining about their unfortunate circumstances.
Case Example—Claire
When 15-year-old Claire came for
therapy for a depressed mood, she reported, among other problems, significant conflict with her mother. Her
mother was invited to attend the next
session. The mother immediately took
control and opened the session by emphatically stating “I am NOT the one
who needs to change, and I have no intention of changing. I am the mother,
and I should not have to change.”
She then proceeded to launch into a
list of complaints and criticisms of her
daughter’s behavior, outlining the
many ways in which she believed that
Claire should change and be more submissive to her authority.
Case Example—Bob
Bob, age 16, was referred for treatment
after being caught under the influence
of alcohol and possibly other drugs at a
school function. Bob denied any misuse
of alcohol and stated that his only problem was that someone told the principal that he had been drinking. When
confronted, Bob stated that he had no
problem and that everyone did it so
that he was being singled out unfairly.
He became angry and felt that everyone
was overreacting to what he characterized as “normal behavior.”
Between the first and second session,
Bob stole his older brother’s ID so that
he could purchase a keg of beer for a
party. When confronted, Bob again became angry and said that this had nothing to do with his alcohol use and his
only problem was in getting caught. Bob
started yelling at his parents for their
own drinking behavior. When his therapist suggested that all of these incidents
involved his use of alcohol, he again
stated that alcohol was not a problem
and refused to talk about it any more.
330 Basic Techniques for Clinicians—Intervention
Patients at this point are actively avoiding, resisting, or opposing change.
They are most often unwilling to work on change and expend great energy displacing blame for their current difficulty. The key statements by the patient are,
“I don’t need to change,” or, “Others should be nicer to me and then I would
not have to change.”
Precontemplation
In the precontemplation stage, a person begins to consider the consequences,
purpose, and the possibility of change but the process is short-circuited. It is a
metacognitive state wherein the patient is thinking about thinking about
change. Patients at this point are not actively considering the implications of
change nor are they significantly invested in resisting or opposing change. They
simply have not considered it, or may be postponing or rationalizing the need
for change. The key attitude of the patient is, “I’ll get around to changing one of
these days if and when I need to,” or “This problem is not really all that bad.”
Precontemplators might passively wait for motivation to strike, perhaps
wishing for things to be different but never focusing sufficient attention to
enter the contemplation stage. Not thinking about change is a way of coping
with the potential stress that actual intentions might precipitate. Energy is required to make a change, and staying the same is easier. It may be the only option if patients lack the energy and supportive resources to initiate and sustain
the change process. The precontemplation stage may be brief or it may be prolonged if nothing compels movement to the next stage. Patients may be vaguely
aware that self-change is needed to solve a particular problem, but they do not
pursue further self-examination in hopes that other circumstances will alleviate the need for such effort. In effect, patients hope that the problem will go
away or become unimportant by one means or another, or that they will feel
more empowered to change under different circumstances in the indeterminate future.
Case Example
Mary was a single, 32-year-old woman
with significant debt. She sensed that
she could do a better job with her finances, but minimized the potential
consequences of this as a problem. She
assumed that she would be getting a
reasonable inheritance eventually and
that she would also marry someone
who would take care of her finances.
Given these two assumptions, she did
not really see a need to develop any
other financial skills and or to label her
current level of functioning in this domain as a problem. Thinking about the
extent of her debts upset her so she just
did not dwell on the subject. She did
not want to try to change her spending
habits because spending less money
would mean a total meltdown of her
personal and social life. She believed
that she was incapable of such change
and that it was really unnecessary and
perhaps even damaging in the long run
anyway. After all, if she did not spend
the money to dress nicely and socialize
in all the “right” places, she would not
be able to meet the husband who was
supposed to pick up the financial reins.
Understanding, Facilitating, and Evaluating Change 331
In precontemplation, the individual is unaware or underaware of problem
behaviors and the associated consequences and has no intention to change any
time in the foreseeable future. Precontemplators may wish for change to occur,
but their idea of change is external or eventual.
Contemplation
Contemplation is the stage in which the person more deeply considers that an
internal problem exists and gives serious thought to personal behavior change
in the near future. However, the person has not yet made a significant commitment to action or established a realistic and effective plan.
Attempts to implement an action-oriented intervention at this stage may
be ineffective or even detrimental, as efficient self-change depends on doing
the right things (processes) at the right time (stage; Prochaska et al., 1992). In
addition, effective change also requires having sufficient circumstantial or social support. Contemplation is thus a critical, systematic, and meaningful stage
that requires sufficient energy and attention.
Case Example
Jessie, a 17-year-old female was referred to treatment after telling her parents that she was addicted to heroin
and felt scared about her escalating use.
Jessie had been using heroin since the
age of 15. She admitted to snorting
heroin on a daily basis and that her use
had escalated from a couple of “lines” a
day to 9 “bags” a day. She had been able
to stop for a maximum of 2 days, but
was unable to stop for a longer time
than that. Jessie stated that she had a
family history of addiction and that a
maternal aunt died of a heroin overdose 2 years earlier. Her parents were
supportive, but they found it difficult
to follow through with treatment recommendations if Jessie objected to
them. Jessie and her parents became
tearful during the initial session as they
talked about the death of her aunt.
Jessie was unable to understand how
she could sometimes hate her addiction
yet remain so attached to it despite the
obvious risks.
During sessions, it became obvious
that Jessie did not have adequate coping skills for simple daily problems let
alone the skill to get through the emotional, physical, and social turmoil of
detoxification and recovery from
heroin dependence. Jessie’s strength
was her intelligence which was evident
in her honor student status in high
school despite her addiction to heroin.
This strength was also a source of liability in her contemplation of change, as it
led her to (erroneously) believe that
she had intellectual control over her
substance use. She thought, “I’m smart
enough to stop whenever I want.
Maybe I will feel like stopping when I
go to college.”
Contemplation is a state of actively considering change. Patients presenting at this stage typically have discomfort and are seeking relief, but lack clarity
in their intention to take on the tasks of change. The patient’s motivation is beginning to build momentum, but could just as easily diminish at this point.
Motivation can be enhanced through specific activities that help the patient
332 Basic Techniques for Clinicians—Intervention
evaluate the risks and benefits of changing versus not changing and begin to develop a concrete understanding of how change occurs.
The therapy goal of contemplation is to help patients consider what they
might be able to do, what will be necessary for success, and why they might
choose to make the effort. Some patients become stuck in the contemplation
stage, substituting repetitive thinking for action, and in effect become “chronic
contemplators” (Prochaska & Norcross, 2003, p. 520). Contemplators are evaluating their options and values in considering self-change, but may be vulnerable to intractable rumination.
Preparation/Action Planning
Preparation is the stage in which intentions and actions begin to converge. The
intention to take action is immediate or close at hand, with significant action
expected within days or weeks. Small but definite behaviors mark this stage,
and these help solidify the intention for additional effort.
Case Example
Sam, a 19-year-old college student came
to therapy stating, “I need to study and
can’t seem to do it all. When I was in
high school I didn’t need to study. I
breezed right through without cracking
a book. Now I’m getting Cs and Ds and
can’t seem to get it together to study and
do the papers. I end up overwhelmed
and then sit around and watch television
even when I know that I need to be
studying.” Sam had begun to carry a
textbook to class so he could review
right before lectures started, but he
needed a more comprehensive plan. He
needed a road map that he could follow
in changing his behavior so that he could
attain better academic performance.
Patients at this point are actively planning change. They have made a
thoughtful decision and are willing to work on the actions needed to fulfill
their change agenda. They are looking for advice on what to do and how to do
it, and will typically attempt to use suggestions the provider may offer. Motivation may increase at this stage, as change is more fully conceptualized as a series of possible behaviors. Motivation may also decrease at this stage, as the
bulk of the action remains ahead, and the patient may cycle back to a previous
stage of contemplation or precontemplation. Support and encouragement to
change as well as a focus on specific small actions can facilitate the patient’s
successful negotiation of the preparation stage.
Action
The action stage is the key point at which observable changes in behavior, experiences, or interactions gain momentum. Patients are making changes within
themselves to overcome a problem. Some patients will enter therapy at this
point, having worked through the contemplation and preparation stages on
their own, with the assistance of friends and other supports, or through previous and related treatment efforts. These are the patients who will respond rapidly to action-oriented techniques and progress quickly in therapy.
Understanding, Facilitating, and Evaluating Change 333
It is a fundamental mistake to assume that every patient entering therapy is at the action stage. Many patients are not really at this stage of readiness or level of motivation to change. This is often because they have not
sufficiently addressed matters of contemplation and preparation, or they do
not have sufficient energy or available resources to support the effort that will
be needed. The patient who is not actually in the action stage may feel an urgent desire to change right away, but does not have a clear sense of what
might be involved or how to deal with practical or psychological challenges in
the execution of change.
Case Example
Jose, a 43-year-old Hispanic male was
referred to outpatient treatment through
the employee assistance program (EAP)
at his place of work after requesting assistance with his substance abuse problem. Jose has been in mental health
treatment for this problem several times
over the past 15 years. He admitted that
he was not ready for change at those
times. However, he now felt that he was
at the point in his life where he would
probably die soon if he didn’t change.
Based on his previous experiences, he
felt that he had a pretty good understanding of what it was going to take to
turn his life around. At intake, he was
diagnosed as chemically dependent with
cocaine as his drug of choice. From the
first session of therapy, Jose was able to
remain abstinent for 45 days and attend
daily 12-step support group meetings as
well as participate in individual and
group counseling. He reported that he
was performing his work at an adequate
level, and he had no current disciplinary
or attendance problems. He followed his
therapist’s suggestion that he monitor
his thoughts and behaviors in a journal
so he could discuss them in his therapy
sessions and generally engaged in a productive alliance with all providers.
Other people in the patient’s life become most aware of changes at the
action stage, and will react according to their own frame of reference. The reactions of others can either help or hinder the patient’s continued effort. However, the efforts of the previous stages will pay off at this point, as those who
have worked through consideration of others reactions’ and made some
preparations for handling this are best equipped to maintain their course of
action.
Those patients who have attempted to go directly into the action stage
without much contemplation or preparation may have the roughest challenge, as they are in effect attempting to leap a tall building in a single bound.
With some sustained action and initial success, motivation can be expected to
increase.
Prelapse
Prelapse is a stage with active and often overwhelming cognitions related to reversal of the changed behavior or pattern of behavior. There is longing for old
times and circumstances, and a resurgence of thoughts and desires consistent
with a return to previous functioning.
334 Basic Techniques for Clinicians—Intervention
The patient is craving an old way of being, but this craving is based on an
idealized memory of the experiences. The desire to return to old ways may be
triggered by current stress, or it may be simply a spontaneous recovery of associations set in motion by an emotionally provocative memory. This is a crucial
junction in the change process, as it may be the beginning of a spontaneous return to a previous level of functioning. However, specific targeted interventions can address this problem early, before an entire chain of behavior is
reactivated.
Case Example
Ryan had a year of sobriety from alcohol
and pot when the stress of Christmas
holidays began to wear on him. Although he felt committed to sobriety
and was happy with his progress, he began to long for the “good old days” of
“partying” and having fun. He felt sorry
for himself because he no longer had the
camaraderie that he had experienced
with drinking buddies. On the day of his
office holiday party, he started having
fond memories of past celebrations.
As he sat in his office listening to the
sounds of merriment down the hall,
with champagne corks popping and beer
bottles clinking with the offering of
cheerful toasts, he began to ruminate
that as a nondrinker, he could no longer
enjoy holiday parties “like everyone
else.” He longed for the imagined happiness of his past. He underrecalled the
negative aspects of this glorious past
when a bottle of beer on Friday led to a
weekend-long binge and trouble showing up sober on Monday. Labeling this
identifiable change as a prelapse might
help Ryan recognize how dangerously
close he was to a behavioral reversal of
change, sliding back toward his substance abuse in an effort to recapture an
idealized past.
This is a crucial point in the change process. Active, directive disputation,
problem solving, and review of cognitive and behavioral skills can short-circuit
the prelapse before it leads to the next stage.
Lapse
Lapse is the stage where the skills needed to go from action to maintenance decrease or are ignored. This is not a full return to prechange patterns, but the
stage is set for relapse to occur. The individual contemplates the reasons for
changing back to old ways, and has behavioral slips in that direction.
Affect during the lapse may run the gamut, from panic to anger to resignation or even relief. What happens at this juncture is critical to whether the
lapse is corrected, or progresses further into a broader relapse of old patterns of
thought, affect, and behavior.
Case Example
Ryan is sitting alone in his office during
the group holiday party, feeling socially
alienated and sorry about his sobriety.
He finally comes to the conclusion,
“Screw it, if I want a beer, I’m going to
have a beer.” So he ambles down the
Understanding, Facilitating, and Evaluating Change 335
Patients at this point are both working at change and starting to revert to
previous patterns of action. They are not immediately opposing change but
they have gotten careless about managing stress, staying focused, and accessing
support for change. They may be going through a natural rejection of the new
behavior or think that they are beyond the need to make a concerted effort.
Relapse
Relapse is the stage at which there is a return to the behaviors that caused the
original referral that had been altered in the action stage. Relapse constitutes a
crisis for most patients. Immediate intervention is crucial for the patient to continue to progress forward and not recycle back to precontemplation or anticontemplation. The patient may think, “I’m right back where I started from” and
begin to recover the original behavior pattern.
Case Example (Continued)
hall and amidst claps of welcome from
his colleagues, he grabs a beer, which
he found tasted “bitter and nasty.” He
looked around at his coworkers and noticed a range of drinking behavior, including two who were not drinking
alcohol at all, a few who he knew
would stop after one or two drinks, and
a couple of guys whom he labeled as
“just like the old me,” already on their
4th drink and likely to make a night or
even a weekend of it.
Case Example
Ryan did not progress into the full relapse stage, which might have involved
joining the guys who were like his “old”
self. Even though he did not progress
from lapse to relapse, he was vulnerable to doing so. If he had greatly enjoyed the drink, embraced his old self
and old buddies, and continued to
think of sobriety as overrated, he might
have been more likely to progress into
full relapse where he returned to all his
old behaviors and made no effort to
change. Lacking the skill to distinguish
prelapse, lapse, and relapse can increase vulnerability to relapse, as one
slip may be magnified into huge failure, with concomitant guilt and resignation. In that case, Ryan might think,
“Well, I’ve done it now. I’ve messed up,
so I might as well enjoy myself.” Such
thoughts provide a gateway to spontaneous recovery of the old patterns,
even if he doesn’t really enjoy himself
very much.
Redirection
Redirection is the process that must be implemented in the prelapse as well as
possible lapse or relapse stages. Redirection involves the recognition that one is
off track concerning change, that further effort is needed to avoid reversal of
change, and that the reasons for making changes may need to be reviewed and
updated. Further, the specific methods of getting back on track and overcoming
the temptation or the lapse/relapse need to be specified. As noted, being able to
336 Basic Techniques for Clinicians—Intervention
distinguish each of these stages is quite helpful for both patient and therapist.
Any indications of these stages are important to the change process, and merit
attention and explicit discussion. It is important to consider and discuss what is
happening when the patient wants to revert to old ways, and when small shifts
in attitude or behavior are noted.
Case Example
Ryan did not automatically understand
these stages of change. Fortunately, he
was an active participant in his therapy,
and he brought up his feelings of frustration and deprivation, and was forthcoming about his behavior, opening the
door for labeling the stages of prelapse
and lapse. He explored his reactions to
the lapse of drinking a beer in some detail, noting that the majority of his associates were either nondrinkers or
moderate drinkers. Thus, his belief that
“everyone” was partying and drinking a
great deal was inconsistent with the evidence from his own observations. A
careful review of his past personal experience helped him remember that he did
not typically drink in moderation, and
that occasional use was neither an effective or satisfying option for him. Redirection efforts included this review of
himself and his reasons for change, a reconsideration of his environment and
his perceptions of others, recommitment
to his specific goals (sobriety), and returning to use of behavior change methods including counterconditioning and
stress management, as well as accessing
social support from his spouse, new
friends, and an online recovery discussion group.
Maintenance
Finally, in the maintenance stage, behavior change is stabilized into an enduring new pattern or lifestyle. One of the most significant challenges is avoiding
relapse or reactivation of previous problematic behaviors.
Patients will present differently at the maintenance stage, as some actively recognize the importance of support and others may be prone to taking
the stability of their changes for granted. Therapeutic goals are to (a) fine-tune
and adjust changes, (b) support growth, (c) encourage stability, and (d) help
patients become their own therapist.
Case Example
Ryan continued treatment for short periods (one to six sessions) over several
years on an “as needed” basis. He completed his master’s degree and found a
job where there was less drinking among
coworkers. After working through a few
additional lapses with redirection and no
relapse, he became more confident in his 
Understanding, Facilitating, and Evaluating Change 337
Although it might be tempting to view maintenance as a static stage with
an absence of change, it is more accurate to consider it an ongoing effort with
unique challenges. Patients actively maintain changes even in new contexts or
situations and are sensitive to cues that indicate the potential for relapse. Patients appreciate their volitional role and understand change as a process that
involves a variety of tasks and resources.
Facilitating Change
Although we are strongly encouraged as therapists to initiate action in the very
first session, to “hit the ground running,” not everyone is at the same stage of
action readiness when therapy begins. Contrary to common assumption, simply presenting for therapy does not mean the patient has already progressed
through contemplation and preparation for change. An individualized approach means working forward from the patient’s current stage at the outset of
therapy, and targeting the intervention to the patient’s state of readiness for
change. Providing a secure, supportive therapeutic environment that focuses
on selected tasks and goals can help the patient find the energy to engage in the
process, tolerate the emotional risks, and titrate the destabilization of moving
from one stage to another.
Patients who enter therapy in a stage of readiness for action are most
likely to have a successful outcome in therapy. A study of smoking cardiac patients found that the pretreatment stage of change was clearly related to outcome, as those who were not smoking at 12 months were those who began the
study either in preparation or action (76%), versus those who were contemplating change (43%), and those who were precontemplators (22%; Ockene,
Ockene, & Kristellar, 1988). Another large study of smokers followed over 18
months found that patients who could progress just one stage forward in a
month more than doubled their likelihood of taking action on their own (Prochaska & DiClemente, 1992).
Case Example (Continued)
ability to maintain change on his own.
For a long period, he was out of contact
with his therapist. Eventually, he was in
line for a managerial position, married,
and raising two children. Ryan decided
to return to regular therapy because he
wanted a tune-up for dealing with the
new stresses in his life. He was keenly
aware that if he did not effectively manage these new stressors, the likelihood
of a relapse would increase. As Ryan
moved further into the demands of the
business world and his adult life, he had
less access to emotional support, and he
found himself questioning his competence to succeed. At this point of maintenance, Ryan needed to focus on the
strengths that had supported his sobriety
over several years and generalize those
skills to the challenges of his current job
and family roles.
338 Basic Techniques for Clinicians—Intervention
Many reasonable candidates for therapy fail to obtain the benefit because
they drop out or terminate treatment prematurely, without any notable change
or problem resolution. Although approximately 30% to 40% of patients terminate prematurely, we cannot reliably predict who will drop out and who will
not. The variables that help predict psychotherapy outcome such as client characteristics or problem duration do not offer much in terms of accurately targeting potential drop-outs. However, one study correctly identified 93% of those
who prematurely terminated by their pretreatment stage of change (Medieros
& Prochaska, 1993). It is no surprise that those who dropped out of treatment
were in the precontemplation stage. Those who terminated quickly but appropriately were those who entered treatment in the action stage, and these were
fewer in number overall. Those who continued in treatment were those who
entered in the contemplation stage. Thus, the patient who can complete a successful therapy in 6 to 10 sessions is one who enters treatment prepared to take
action. The patient who attends some therapy but fails to benefit is likely to be
stalled at the stage of precontemplation. Those patients who have more complex problems and less preparation for change will have a longer course of psychotherapy, extending from 6 months to years, if they can be engaged in a
process of contemplation and planning action.
Is it important to use methods or processes that are targeted to specific
stages? The empirical answer to that question is yes. Significant evidence accumulated from over 20 years of research in behavioral medicine and psychotherapy shows the differential effectiveness of different processes (Prochaska &
Norcross, 2003), including a recent meta-analysis of 47 cross-sectional studies
showing a large effect of different processes across the stages (C. S. Rosen,
2000). The results of this body of research offer psychotherapists an evidencedbased foundation for systematic and efficient use of psychotherapy methods
and procedures to facilitate change.
Adjusting Intervention to Stage of Change
How do people move through the stages of change? The initial steps appear to
be consciousness or awareness of a problem and whether the problem is biological (physical symptoms or impairments), psychological (emotional distress,
cognitive impairments, behavioral dysfunctions), or social (interpersonal, role,
family, or community impairment), or some combination of these dimensions.
At the precontemplation stage (and its variants), little time or energy is invested in self-evaluation. If there are negative aspects to a problem, the individual does not react much to them. At this stage, the person is rather closed to
new information, perhaps even downright hostile as noted, and will resist owning the problem or planning behavior changes.
The most helpful therapeutic stance for precontemplation is likely to be a
supportive approach that draws patients into a consideration of their circumstances. Offering an opportunity to examine thoughts and feelings in an understanding and nondemanding atmosphere may help the patient move toward
greater recognition that a possible problem exists. Providing the patient with
normative information may also be useful, as a reference point for the patient’s
self-evaluation.
Understanding, Facilitating, and Evaluating Change 339
The greatest challenge at this stage is developing a rapport that fosters
problem exploration and keeps the patient engaged in the treatment process.
Just intellectually recognizing there is a problem, however, is not likely to be
sufficient for progressing toward contemplation of change. Some emotional
connection to the consequences of the problem is needed. The problem has to
matter in some emotionally relevant way. Bringing this emotional component
into awareness can be accomplished through a variety of affective techniques
such as expressive dialogue or guided discussion of personal values, culturally
relevant impacts, and socially normative alternatives.
Fortuitous life events that affect the patient, even through observation
only, may help bring feelings into consciousness. The diagnosis or loss of a loved
one to a serious illness may be a wake-up call to contemplation. Near-death experiences of the patient or others may precipitate caring enough about chronically maladaptive conditions. For example, a young soldier has a near-death
experience in combat, and decides that his life at home will significantly change
on his return. He is prompted to seriously consider his passive acceptance of his
spouse’s alcohol abuse and neglect of the children and home, and how inconsistent that is with his desired family life. This leads to planning the steps he will
begin to take to change this unhappy and no longer acceptable situation.
The contemplation stage is marked by increased openness to information
and self-evaluation. Interventions such as clinical assessment as well as psychoeducation, bibliotherapy, and exposure to the coping strategies used by others are helpful at this point. Empowered by more thorough information, the
patient has the tools to evaluate options. A therapeutic stance of guiding the
patient through information gathering and decision making is helpful, along
with the use of truly exploratory Socratic questions. Attention to the patient’s
key values is central to moving this process along, as it is the effects most cared
about that will spur the effort to action. It is also important to examine the
sources of ambivalence about change as the patient also has a valued attachment to some aspects of the behavior in question. As noted, some patients—
and some therapists—are prone to become stuck in the contemplation stage,
endlessly considering issues and feelings, but not taking the next step of determining what direction is important in the patient’s life. Both may believe, mistakenly, that continuous rumination about options can reduce anxiety or
discomfort with the available options, and that keeping options open will result
in a more satisfactory outcome in the long run. As patients evaluate what matters most and the impact on significant others, some sense of direction should
emerge. This will help move patients into the next stage, of preparing to take
action. Chronic contemplation can be identified as a specific choice of action
that results in vague commitment and ongoing discomfort, rather than more effective choices.
In the preparation stage, patients formulate a plan for what to change and
how to change it, with specific action steps beginning to take shape. The path of
change may not be detailed down to the minutiae, but there are goals and priorities and some idea of how to achieve these objectives. The therapist continues to
provide support and encouragement, and also coaches patients on specific methods or procedures that are apt to facilitate success. Small action steps are recognized and highly encouraged. In this stage, the therapist shares the methods of
340 Basic Techniques for Clinicians—Intervention
psychotherapy in ways that empower patients to see that change is possible and
within their control. The therapist can help focus patients’ efforts, and provide
crucial reassurance that their actions are contributing to a productive purpose.
Patients may be hesitant and overwhelmed at this point, and often need liberal
doses of reinforcement for their initial change efforts.
In the action stage, therapists help maintain the affective and cognitive
foundations of the earlier stages and provide technical support for the behavioral change efforts. They can help patients effectively apply techniques of
counterconditioning, stimulus control, and contingency management, as well as
manage thoughts or emotions that might get in the way of using the behavioral
technology. Encouragement, accountability, and partnership all are important in
the action stage. Patients are surrounded by advice on the action of change, and
may be drawn off track by many distractions or misdirections. Others’ suggestions may be helpful and right on target, or they may be poorly informed or
downright sabotaging to the patient’s intentions. Thus, an effective therapeutic
stance is that of an informed (and patient) consultant who knows the particulars
of the patient’s situation and is keeping track of both progress and direction of
change. The therapist can encourage persistence when the changes become difficult, tedious, or questionable. When one method doesn’t seem to be working,
the therapist can be helpful in offering alternative strategies if needed.
Maintenance begins when the change has been substantially implemented
for a noted period of time, often 6 months or longer. Prelapse, lapse, and relapse
are important at this stage as well as ways to cope with these stressors through
redirection. Developing a new or adjusted sense of identity is also important for
success in the maintenance stage. The patient incorporates the problem into his
or her view of self, and the accomplished or ongoing change as desirable and
real. Ryan, the patient described earlier in the stages of change, came to see
himself as a person in recovery from alcohol and substance abuse. A smoker
begins to think of himself as a nonsmoker. A patient with agoraphobia thinks of
herself as a highly sensitive but functioning and mobile individual. The betterdefined the change is, and the more clearly the patient can articulate a positive
sense of identity to associate with the change, the more likely it is that change
can be maintained without spiraling back to earlier stages.
The procedures most helpful at this stage include reviewing reasons to
maintain the change, behavioral ways to maintain the change, and enhancing
identification and contact with others who behave this way and who endorse
the new identity. Risks at this stage include overestimating the stability of the
behavior change, underestimating the need for any ongoing effort or sensitivity to potential to lapse or relapse, and under-utilizing productive interpersonal support.
Evaluating Change
Measuring Change
Measurement of change in psychotherapy is a somewhat controversial issue.
Many clinicians do not use external measures of outcome or patient change in
Understanding, Facilitating, and Evaluating Change 341
their clinical practice. In one survey (Hatfield & Ogles, 2004), only 37.1% of 874
responding psychologists said they used any form of outcome measure in practice. This is similar to other reports of 29% (Phelps, Eisman, & Kohout, 1998),
and 23% of child and adolescent clinicians (Bickman et al., 2000). There are also
many providers and consumers who think that measurement of change is an important component of a systematic approach to clinical practice. Thus, it is important to understand the factors that facilitate or hinder this action in practice.
According to the Hatfield and Ogles (2004) survey of a random sample of
practitioner members of APA (American Psychological Association), training in
the use of outcome assessment strategies was significantly related to practitioners’ behavior. Presumably, training helps providers to know what measures to
use, how and when to use them, and whether it is clinically useful to do so.
Further, this survey explored both the uses and barriers to measuring change in
clinical practice. The most important uses were in tracking progress since intake, measuring overall problem severity, evaluating specific problems, and
tracking the maintenance of therapeutic gains over time. The barriers to outcome measurement were either practical or strategic. The practical reasons
were things such as taking too much time or burdening the patient or therapist
with paperwork, and the strategic reasons related to incompatibility with therapeutic approach or threat to professional integrity or confidentiality. Overall,
the strategic reasons were less prominent than practical ones as a factor in practitioner behavior.
For the measurement of change to be a functional component of the treatment process, the methods need to meet basic assessment criteria of reliability
and validity, as well as be suitable to the problem and treatment setting. The
most commonly used methods involve well-standardized, easily administered
symptom checklists that provide direct measures of specific problems. These include the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI-II; A. T. Beck et al., 1996), the Beck
Anxiety Inventory (BAI; A. T. Beck, Epstein, Brown, & Steer, 1988), the Child
Behavior Checklist (CBCL; Achenbach, 1991), and the SCL-90-R (Derogatis,
1983; Hatfield & Ogles, 2004). Patients can complete these inventories quickly
and easily in a waiting area, or in the first few minutes of a meeting. Many
other clinical instruments are potentially available for use in evaluating specific
clinical problems and overall severity or tracking progress over time. These can
frequently be located either through test vendors, or through a research literature review for a specific problem.
Other options for measuring patient change over the course of treatment
include individualized tracking of target behaviors, changes in the global assessment of functioning, and reports of the patient or significant others concerning relevant psychological or emotional changes. These methods are
discussed in depth in Chapters 7 and 8. Observational methods of charting
change are particularly helpful because of the direct relevance to the main reasons for seeking therapy. Patients often come to therapy with a specific agenda
of changing a behavior, solving a problem, or improving their functioning.
Guiding a patient through self-assessment for evidence of change, or lack of
change in the presenting problem is important both for patient satisfaction and
feedback to the clinician on the usefulness of treatment.
Measuring specific target behavior can be useful in the process of tracking
change because it is both observable and quantifiable. One option is to measure
342 Basic Techniques for Clinicians—Intervention
increases in functional behaviors such as regular exercise or social contacts.
Another option is to measure decreases in harmful behaviors such as purging,
cutting, or school or work truancy. It may not always be easy to identify a specific target behavior to track as context plays a role in whether a behavior is
functional or dysfunctional. However, this can be taken into consideration
when determining the target. Being present in the workplace is generally a
functional behavior, but staying at work for excessive hours while obsessively
checking is not adaptive. Thus, the behavior to track might include the number
of days where work was completed within designated work hours, without
repetitive checking. In most instances, a brief inquiry and patient self-report or
self-monitoring is sufficient to measure and track the progress in these areas
over time. Depending on the clinical context, other sources of information may
be added to the patient’s report to get the most reliable index of change. An example of this is the patient in drug treatment who submits a urine sample to be
tested for substances as a corroboration of his or her self-report of abstinence.
Behavioral tools are relatively easy to use, require minimal time or paperwork to administer, and may enhance the integrity of the treatment by tracking
progress toward overall objectives. At least one measure of symptoms and one
target behavior to track for increases or decreases can easily provide a foundation
of change measurement for routine practice. If the patient’s desired outcome is to
be less stressed and worried and to live a calmer lifestyle, we might use an anxiety checklist to track both problem severity and progress over time. In addition,
we might ask the patient to monitor the frequency of tension-reducing activities
such as exercise or meditation. Thus, the measurement of change can be streamlined in a way that is both workable and valuable to the clinical process.
Communicating about Change
An important feature of contemporary therapy is the frequent occurrence of
direct communications about change between patient and therapist and possibly clinical and external third parties. Patients and therapists talk about the
processes and methods of change and are likely to directly discuss expectations,
responsibilities, and satisfaction with the rate and direction of change. Communications about change may take place either in a formal, written context, or in
an informal or conversational exchange. The particular concerns of any communication vary with the intended audience, so we will give separate consideration to patients, external third parties, and clinical third parties.
Communicating with Patients about Change
Discussion of change is typically part of the agenda whenever the patient and
therapist have contact. When a patient and therapist meet, the patient reports
on changes experienced since the last meeting, for better or worse. If the patient
does not spontaneously report such developments, the therapist will inquire and
attempt to socialize the patient toward noticing and reporting changes.
The focusing of attention on noticeable differences helps the patient to recognize the process of change as it is happening. Noticing improvements also encourages a cognitive shift toward more constructive focus of attention. This
discussion may involve changes in affect in specific situations or encounters,
Understanding, Facilitating, and Evaluating Change 343
changes in overall mood, changes in thoughts, attitude, or mental activity, or
changes in behaviors or actions. The data used to guide such discussion may
come from the symptom inventories or self-monitoring records or diaries assigned as homework, or may come from the patient’s recollection and self-report.
Observations of others may also be part of the change data, as shared by the patient’s report or perhaps directly communicated by the outside entity.
Over time, as the clinician gathers a database of experience and information, a repertoire of relevant questions can be developed. Some of those questions may become part of clinical routine, perhaps asking each patient, “What
changes have you experienced since we last met?” As you get to know different
patients, you can help them spot changes that are particularly relevant to their
interpersonal and intrapsychic world. This discussion of change adds meaning
and depth to differences that may be evident on symptom inventories or other
measures of functioning. If you know that a given client has often responded
passively to challenges or difficulties at work, it will be easier to notice and comment on a report of behaving more assertively with a work project. Or you may
be able to help a patient see that certain discrete actions such as volunteering to
chair a committee are important shifts in a more functional direction, even (or
especially) when difficult feelings like anxiety are part of the experience.
The clinician’s professional opinion on the evidence of progress and relevance of change is typically important in encouraging the patient’s persistence
and motivation in treatment. Sometimes it is required by third-party payers in
the form of a treatment progress report, where specific clinical information is
required. Thus, it is crucial to pay attention to the change taking place and
provide feedback to the patient on your observations. Much of the time, the
feedback is delivered in the course of discussion, but other structured communications may be useful or necessary. The structure of the communication will depend on the clinical context and vary in degree of complexity.
A simple structured communication might be a summary and perhaps
charting of symptom index measures over the course of treatment, which is
communicated informally to the patient in the course of ongoing treatment.
You might use a whiteboard or graph paper and list changes in the Beck Depression Inventory over the course of several weeks of treatment, to show the
client visually how much change has taken place (see Figure 12.1). By discussing this during a treatment session, you can talk about what steps, interventions, or changes accompanied the shifts in symptoms.
In the case illustrated in Figure 12.1, the initial slight increase in moodrelated symptoms was related to specific stressors, including a major work project that coincided with children’s health problems and other family challenges.
The drop in symptoms noted between Sessions 11 and 14 was associated with
some alleviation in the situational stresses, and continued use of specific coping
skills. The client could see that as she continued to make the effort to resolve
her stress and cope as effectively as possible, she began to feel considerably better, even though she still faced day-to-day challenges.
Communicating with Care Management and Other External Third Parties
When it is necessary to communicate with third-party care managers, a more
complex and formal communication is typically required. For patients using
some form of managed behavioral health care insurance coverage, this is a
common requirement for accessing benefits, as of this writing. Most often, a
specific form is provided by the managed care company for the clinician to
complete, either on paper or by secured electronic submission.
Managed care progress reports typically require the clinician to report a
diagnosis and ratings of the severity of stressors and overall functioning, as well
as the presence of risk indicators such as self-harming behaviors or substance
abuse, medications being used, communications with other primary care
providers, and need for additional treatment. Thus beginning to gather this information at the onset of therapy will enable completing this important communication in a timely manner.
A care manager subsequently reviews this information and either provides approval for additional treatment, denies payment authorization based on
the patient’s insurance contract, or requests further discussion of the client’s
care with the clinician if warranted. Follow-up with the clinician is most likely
when there are any questions about the patient’s risk level, such as with suicidal intent, to ensure that treatment is of sufficient quality and intensity to
meet the patient’s needs.
Denial of authorization by an insurance carrier is primarily a denial of authorization of payment under the patient’s contract for service. This does not mean
that a patient is disallowed to continue treatment, but rather that the patient and

therapist must determine an appropriate course of action that is in the patient’s
best interest, including alternative payment arrangements or use of alternative
treatment or community support resources. Insurance carriers make decisions
about authorizing payment for services; the patient and therapist make decisions
about what services are needed and what the options and alternatives may be.
The most complex and formal communication with an external third
party might be a written report that summarizes repeated observations, assessments, or the results of multiple test instruments across time. This written report may be distributed to one or more parties, and may or may not be released
to the patient, depending on the circumstances. In the instance of a complex
and formal written summary or opinion, this would most likely have been
specified as an objective at the beginning of the treatment consultation, and appropriate informed consent obtained (e.g., the patient may have been remanded to treatment by an outside entity such as the court, and the formal
report is required as a condition of the order).
Beginning clinicians are advised that this latter circumstance is a specialized application of clinical practice requiring appropriate training and
supervised experience to effectively execute both the treatment and the corresponding communications. Any release of written clinical information
should be done deliberately and carefully, to ensure that appropriate safeguards to patient confidentiality are maintained, and that appropriate ethical
and legal responsibilities are addressed.
Communicating with Clinical Third Parties
Several clinical situations involve communications about patient change with
third parties who are part of the treatment process. One is when the therapist is
part of a treatment team, as often occurs in hospital, clinic, or school settings
where other professionals are also working with the patient on a target health
or mental health problem. Typically, the team will have a set time to discuss
progress and relevant concerns of their patients, but this may not always be the
case. If there is not a designated time for a team meeting, the clinician may need
to initiate contact with other treating professionals to exchange information
about the patient.
In all such cases, a written consent from the patient, or the patient’s parent or guardian in the case of a minor, is required for such information to be
disclosed or exchanged with any third party. This written consent may be
woven into the routine intake procedure, for example when a patient is seen in
a medical clinic such as pediatric diabetes clinic or adolescent eating disorders
clinic. If the consent is not obtained on intake, a specific discussion of informed
consent for this communication needs to be conducted with the patient, along
with signed documentation of the discussion and consent.
Although the consent for this communication needs to be specifically
structured, the information that is actually exchanged is typically less structured as the treating professionals simply discuss their observations, concerns,
and notations of progress or change. This communication serves many purposes. These include helping establish common goals, sharing points of encouragement, identifying any obstacles to further change, and generally helping
everyone be “on the same page” in providing consistent and coherent care.
Understanding, Facilitating, and Evaluating Change 345
Beginning clinicians are often hesitant to discuss a patient with other professionals who may take a very different perspective on the patient’s problems,
or perhaps be less than sensitive to psychological considerations. Such communications can be productively directed by keeping the focus on the patient’s best
interest and realizing that differences in perspectives are part of the reason for
the exchange of information. Sharing features of the psychological case conceptualization with other involved clinicians helps them have a broader understanding of the patient and contribute to the patient’s overall quality of care.
The psychological perspective is a unique and valuable contribution to a multidisciplinary consultation.
Another circumstance involving communications with clinically involved
third parties is interactions with family members or significant others of the patient. These communications can be crucial to the ongoing process of change,
yet should always be guided by the priority of the patient’s best interest. Both
clinical skill and knowledge of the boundaries of confidentiality are needed to
successfully execute such contacts. There are many possible circumstances
where the clinician will receive inquiries about the patient’s progress and potential for change, and not all of them merit a direct response. If there is any
doubt, the superordinate ethical standard of privacy and confidentiality (APA,
2002; 4.00–4.07) should prevail, at least until the situation can be clarified.
Family members, including spouses or parents of majority age young
adults, do not automatically have a right to information concerning the patient,
unless the patient gives specific consent to disclosure. This is true even if the familial third party is paying the bill. The consent for disclosure should be obtained formally for adult patients, in the manner noted for other treating
professionals. The patient may also provide informal consent by bringing a significant other along to a consultation, although it still must be ascertained that
the patient is freely consenting and not being coerced by the significant other.
Where minor children are concerned, a delicate balance must be maintained between protecting the confiding relationship and keeping parents informed so that they can appropriately manage their parental responsibilities. A
general guideline many child clinicians follow is that of making discussion of
change and progress with parents a part of the treatment plan, and informing
their youthful patients at the outset of treatment of necessary disclosure under
any circumstances of harm, danger, high-risk behavior or illegal behavior.
When a patient brings someone into a therapy session such as a partner,
family member, or friend, that person is referred to as a collateral participant in
the patient’s treatment. For a minor, it is usually preferable that at least one parent be involved as a collateral participant in treatment. When the collateral party
enters the treatment room, it is made clear that he or she is not a patient, has no
record of being a patient, and has no rights or privileges regarding information
shared, or financial responsibility (unless as a financially responsible parent).
Sometimes, clinicians have the participant review and sign a formal collateral consent form. The collateral consent form specifically outlines that the person is participating in the therapy at the patient’s request, and for the patient’s
benefit. If it appears that the collateral participant has a personal agenda for
therapy, then it would most likely be appropriate to provide a referral to another provider, or to direct that agenda to designated family therapy sessions.
346 Basic Techniques for Clinicians—Intervention
Clarity in structuring these contacts can help keep the patient’s treatment focused, and prevent any disruption by the interests of others.
With an appropriate structure, there can be many benefits of having communications with significant others as collateral participants. Others often play
an important role in either reinforcing or discouraging change. Sometimes they
interfere with change because they do not have a clear idea about how to best
direct their efforts. Family members may be frightened by emotional distress,
and may worry that placing any demands on the patient will cause the person
to worsen, snap, or have a nervous breakdown. Significant others may be confused about the reasons for psychological symptoms and engage in a pattern of
coercion or negative communication with the patient as a result of their own
frustration. They may be very stressed by the patient’s problems, and pressuring
the patient to use simple solutions, such as to “stop whining and get over yourself.” The tension caused by the “hurry up and get over it” message may greatly
exacerbate the overall distress of everyone. Family members may be reacting
with anger or shame, compounding the patient’s sense of demoralization.
In many clinical situations, significant others either underrespond or
overrespond in assuming some portion of influence on the problem. “What
have I done to cause this?” may be part of their inner struggle, when they are
not a causative element. Alternatively, the defensive posture of “this is not my
problem; you need to fix him/her” can exacerbate the patient’s sense of interpersonal isolation. In such cases, collateral contacts can provide an opportunity
to discuss realistic expectations for the pace and extent of change that is likely,
and what specific attitudes and behaviors are likely to help or hinder the desired change.
With few exceptions, communications with collateral contacts are apt to
have the greatest success when face-to-face discussion is used, rather than formal or written statements. Significant others benefit from sharing information,
having their input taken into consideration, being involved as a relevant party,
and becoming informed about the treatment and expectations for progress. In
informal discussion, their understanding and reactions can be checked, and
their concerns resolved or at least considered.
Written documents provide a much greater risk for misinterpretation or
distortion in a way that may not be beneficial to the patient, and there is less
opportunity to discern what further understanding might be needed. In situations where there are written communications to significant others, as in providing a copy of a psychoeducational evaluation to parents, it is important to
offer an opportunity to explain and discuss what is contained in the report in
language that the family members can understand (APA, 2002, 9.10).
Summary
Change in psychological and behavioral functioning is best conceptualized as a
complex and cumulative process rather than a discrete occurrence at a single
point in time. The patient always remains both the agent and the object of the
change process, setting the pace and determining the extent of emotional risk
Understanding, Facilitating, and Evaluating Change 347
allowed. In the cumulative process of change, there are as many as 10 different
stages of an evolving complex of emotions, thoughts, motivations, and actions.
If we are alert to the stages of change, interventions can be selected for their
usefulness in facilitating progress toward the next step. Evaluating or measuring at least some behavioral and symptomatic aspects of the patient’s functioning is important in demonstrating progress through the stages and toward a
productive purpose. Throughout planning, facilitating, and measuring progress,
there are ongoing communications with the patient about change. This communication may also include others involved in the treatment as third-party
payers and managers of care, other treating professionals, or significant others
who play a role in the change process as part of the patient’s life. Our ability as
clinicians to understand, facilitate, measure, and communicate about a patient’s change affects the focus and direction of treatment, the patient’s engagement, persistence, and motivation, and the successful use of external resources.



Bringing about change is not a simple matter. Even when the clinician is
prepared with the latest scientifically based methods, a comprehensive
conceptualization, and an accurate understanding of the client’s progress in the
cycle of change, impediments may still need to be addressed during therapy.
These obstacles to progress stem from several sources. Although it is tempting
to attribute the obstacles exclusively to conflicts within the client, it is necessary to consider other possible explanations to effectively work through these
clinical barriers.
Before reading the following discussion, ask yourself to think about what
you believe most stands in the way of change. Are the barriers to change in the
client, the therapist, the environment, or embedded in the problem? If clients
claim that they simply cannot change a problem behavior (e.g., overeating), are
the obstacles to change caused by the client’s poor impulse control, the therapist’s misdirected approach, an overabundance of food surrounding the client,
or food addiction and bad genetics?
Learning Objectives
At the end of this chapter, the reader should be able to:
• Describe how the client can be a source of therapeutic impediment.
• Describe how the therapist can be a source of therapeutic impediment.
• Describe how the environment can be a source of therapeutic impediment.
• Describe how the psychological disorder can be a source of therapeutic
impediment.
• Describe how the therapist can remain relatively unaffected by resistance.
350 Basic Techniques for Clinicians—Intervention
Throughout this text, we have stressed the collaborative nature of the
therapeutic effort. When there is change in the expected and agreed-on direction, when clients can do things that they did not previously attempt, when the
client’s life and efforts are moving in positive and desired directions, both the
therapist and the client experience success and fulfillment. However, like true
love, the course of therapy never (or rarely) runs smoothly. There will be relapses, stagnation, plateaus, backward movement, and even active resistance to
change. This does not necessarily stop therapy, nor does it necessarily injure the
therapeutic efforts. Detours may slow things down, but they can be used for
positive effect. They are, in fact, expected and even to be sought after. After all,
if the client can get back on track in the therapy after a slip, it suggests that they
are building and honing life skills. It provides evidence for the client that a slip
is not the end of the process or a failure. It simply tests clients’ skills so that
they can stay on track when therapy is over.
When therapy gets “stuck,” it is tempting (and simplistic) to blame treatment difficulty (or lack of progress in therapy) on the client’s noncompliance or
resistance. With certain clients and client types, this is easy to do. Adolescents
who generally do not choose therapy on their own, those remanded to therapy
by the judicial system, or those sent to therapy by a family member may be
prone to avoid or resist therapy. This is also true of clients with chronic and pervasive disorders, who have experienced life in a certain way over many years.
After all, if they have been in therapy for many years and have not as yet resolved their myriad difficulties, then how can any one therapist be expected to
help them?
Therapists may find it is convenient to judge some clients as untreatable.
Seeing a client as untreatable lifts any demand or expectation that the therapist
should work longer, harder, or more creatively with the client. Therapists often
assume that when there is no therapeutic movement or when progress lags, it is
because the client does not want to change or get well for conscious or unconscious reasons. Many issues, circumstances, and problems can slow or block
progress in therapy, and only a few are due to the client’s wanting to retain
problems. Think of a “self-help” or “self-improvement” task that you have attempted. This might be losing weight, exercising more regularly, or completing
unfinished, overdue paperwork. To what extent is the lack of follow-through
due to a secret desire to remain fat, out of shape, or lag behind in your paperwork? To what extent is it due to more mundane factors such as personal comfort, time limitations, anxiety, or perfectionism, and to what extent is it some
combination of these factors?
Impediments to change in therapy are costly to clients in terms of their
ongoing pain and discomfort and the price they pay for continued dysfunction.
The cost in human terms is compounded by the economic loss to the individual
and to the economy. It has been estimated that the cost of depression to U.S.
business is 30 to 44 billion dollars per year (Elinson, Houk, Marcus, & Pincus,
2004; Stewart, Ricci, Chee, Hahn, & Morganstein, 2003). This represents the
combined expenses for psychological care, medications, and hospitalization,
and the cost of lost wages due to decreased productivity and absenteeism. Obviously, the financial burden to agencies and institutions is monumental. Estimates of the costs of untreated mental health disorders indicate an additional
Impediments to Change 351
70 billion dollars of lost productivity per year (U.S. Department of Health and
Human Services, 1999). Finally, the emotional and economic costs to families
of delayed or limited change is incalculable. Therapists are not immune to the
price of extended therapy in that noncompliance makes the therapy work more
difficult and personally wearing. This can lead to decreased effectiveness and
ultimately to therapist burnout.
Definitions of Resistance
In traditional psychoanalytic terms, resistance was primarily conceptualized as a
negative patient variable, and a form of pathology embedded in a narcissistic,
false, and pathological character that strove to maintain the status quo at any
cost (Menninger, 1958; Stark, 1994). Campbell (2003) addressed the topic of resistance from a psychoanalytic position. He differentiated between id, ego, or
superego resistances. He identified common themes of client resistance to therapy as involving distrust of the therapist, personal shame, grievances against
others, depreciation, or fear of rejection. Typically, resistance may be manifested
directly (e.g., tardiness or missing of appointments) or more subtly through
omissions in the material reported in the sessions. Writing in 1914, Freud,
quoted in Fine (1979) stated, “It may thus be said that the theory of psychoanalysis is an attempt to account for two striking and unexpected facts of observation which emerge whenever an attempt is made to trace the symptoms of a
neurotic back to sources in his past life; the facts of transference and resistance”
(p. 52).
There are many reasons for noncompliance other than the client not wanting to change or wanting punishment. Resistance is no longer being viewed as
entirely negative or as only a patient variable. Several authors (Adelman & Taylor, 1986; Ellis, 1985; Gerber & Nehemkis, 1986; Meichenbaum & Gilmore, 1982;
Milman & Goldman, 1987) have considered the adaptive nature of resistance.
Many volumes have explored this important issue from a variety of perspectives
(Ellis, 1985; Leahy, 2004, Wachtel, 1982).
Rather than use the term resistance, which has come to mean an action of
the client, we have chosen to use the term impediment to change (Freeman & McCloskey, 2004). This implies that there are many roadblocks (Leahy, 2004) or
speed bumps that do not have to stop progress, but may slow it down. No one
impediment is more powerful or influential than any other. The impact that an
impediment has on the therapeutic progress is related to the meaning to the
client, how the impediment manifests itself, how the therapist deals with it, or
a combination of all of the preceding factors.
Clinically, we can identify several explanations for the impediments to
change that may appear to be the client’s resistance or noncompliance. Impediments can appear in any combination or permutation, and the relative strength
of any noncompliant action may change with the client’s life circumstance, progress in therapy, relationship with the therapist, and so on. We can divide these
impediments to therapy into four broad categories. The first set of impediments is
problems coming from the client. In the second category of impediments are
352 Basic Techniques for Clinicians—Intervention
those roadblocks that emanate from the therapist and the therapeutic interaction.
The third category includes factors related to the client’s life situation, personal
context, and significant others. The final factors come from the type, severity,
and nature of the client’s problem(s) or behavior. In the following discussion, we
describe therapeutic interventions for reducing or ameliorating these problems
and impediments to therapeutic change.
The manifestation of these impediments may take many forms. Some
would appear more directly negative: verbal or behavioral evasion (“I forgot my
homework for the session. So what?”), verbal hostility (“You are a lousy therapist and haven’t helped me at all.”), threats of physical aggression (“I’ll get you
if you turn me in.”), or threats against the institution or agency (“I’ll blow this
place up.”). Other impediments may be more subtle: frequent lateness for appointments, missing appointments, or extended silence in sessions. And yet
other behaviors may appear positive, but still interfere with progress: trying to
win the therapist over with praise (“You are the best therapist I have ever
had.”), gifts (“I saw this and thought how nice it would look in your office.”), or
statements of devotion (“I could never work with any other therapist.”).
Roadblocks may be conscious, such as when the client chooses to withhold information and details from the therapist so as to appear healthier,
smarter, and more competent (e.g., not reporting having failed a test, gotten a
traffic ticket, or being unable to accomplish a homework task). The same material might also not be reported to the therapist because of “forgetting,” a process
that might be more unconscious (“Didn’t I tell you about Jim breaking up with
me? I thought that I did.”).
A starting point for understanding the impediments to change is to conceptualize the client’s actions as a normal and adaptive response to threat.
Whether the behavior is viewed as an ego defense or as a response to unfamiliar demands, it is unreasonable to expect that an individual will move directly
to change without some level of discomfort, avoidance, or reactance. In point of
fact, an individual who moves too quickly to change may be impulsive, unstable, or labile. The client with a borderline personality disorder may move
quickly from idealization of the therapist (“You are the best.”) to devaluation
(“You are worthless as a therapist.”). Both extremes need to be identified and
addressed directly within the therapy.
Many of our clients have been in therapy at some previous point. If the
previous therapeutic experience has not been successful, it would be essential
for the therapist to first assess what was done in the previous therapy in terms
of the focus, direction, content, timing, cadence, and style of the therapy.
What was the client’s view of the therapist (both personally and professionally)? What strategies and techniques worked in the therapy and what was left
undone or poorly done? How well did the client think that the therapy met
their needs? What were, in the client’s view, the most helpful and therapeutic
experiences?
With that information in hand, the therapist can work to alter any and all
the factors emblematic of the negative aspects of the previous therapy so that
the present therapy is experienced as different and not more of the same old
pattern. If the previous therapy was free-floating and unstructured, structure
would offer a different therapeutic experience. If the content revolved around
Impediments to Change 353
a particular issue, shifting to a variant of that issue, or even a different issue
could be helpful. Different examples could be useful. The goal is to make the
present therapy a new experience and opportunity for change. If the previous
therapy was successful and fulfilling of the client’s needs, but ended due to outside forces (loss of insurance or the therapist leaving the agency), the therapist
can try to follow and use what worked before. For the previously “therapized”
client, the current therapist must be creative in finding new directions or foci.
Bordin’s Model of the Working Alliance
Bordin’s model (1979) of the working alliance emphasizes the agreement about
the goals and tasks of therapy and the establishment of a positive, interpersonal
bond between client and therapist as being crucial to the success of therapy.
Many of the identified impediments to therapy appear to be related to difficulties in the establishment of the working alliance. Lack of clarity in the definition of problems and related goals, lack of precision in the definition of the
tasks of treatment, and confusion about the division of labor in treatment and
the failure to establish a collaborative, goal-directed relationship can severely
limit the effectiveness of treatment.
We have found it useful to separate the working alliance into its component
parts and to deal with them in a more focused manner. We use the term working alliance or therapeutic alliance to mean the therapeutic goals and contract
between therapist and client. This contract or treatment plan needs to be explicit and negotiated early in the therapy. In this way, the goals of therapy will
be clear, as well as the direction of the therapy, the potential time line for therapy, the elements of the therapy, the strategies that might be used in the therapy, and the people who might be called on to contribute to the therapy (family
members, significant others).
We use the term therapeutic bond to refer to the relationship between the
therapist and the client. For some clients the relationship may be the central
focus. For other clients, the alliance may be far more important. The focus on
one does not, in any way, ignore or diminish the importance of the other. It may
be a question of which will be the ascendant feature at a particular point in
therapy. If a client were to come into an emergency facility with suicidal
ideation or after a suicide gesture or attempt, the therapeutic relationship may
be secondary to the need to act immediately and directly on helping the client
toward safety. Clients who need emotional support to accomplish their goals
may need far more of the therapeutic bond to provide the environment for
change.
Impediments to Treatment and Change
Some impediments to treatment may not reside within the person of the therapist or of the client. Cultural, familial, social, and interpersonal factors may all
354 Basic Techniques for Clinicians—Intervention
contribute to difficulties encountered in the treatment setting. In addition, factors related to the health and medical well-being of the client may contribute to
the degree of difficulty encountered in attempting to implement a structured,
planned intervention. As an extension of Bordin’s work, we identify four broad
areas that may interfere with, or even halt therapeutic progress: client factors,
therapist factors, environmental factors, and factors related to the problems or
pathology that brings the individual to seek therapy.
Client Factors
These are cognitive, affective, or behavioral aspects of the client, and may even
be seen as typical of their style. These characteristics may be clear, obvious, and
overt and not easily missed. Or, these characteristics may be far more limited
and evident only under stress, or when the individual experiences threat. They
may include the following:
• The client lacks skills to comply with the therapeutic requirements or
tasks.
• Previous treatment experience, often of failure, has produced negative
expectations or cynicism.
• The client fears that others will be hurt or impacted in a negative way by
the changes produced in therapy.
• There is secondary gain from maintaining symptoms, for the client or significant others.
• The client fears the experience of change or being “different.”
• The client lacks compelling reasons to change.
• The client has a generally negative set toward therapy.
• The client has limited ability for self-monitoring of thoughts, feelings, and
behavior.
• The client has limited or poor ability to monitor the responses and reactions of others.
• The client has a demanding or self-centered interpersonal style.
• The client has a low tolerance for frustration and expects progress to be
effortless and rapid.
• The client perceives being in therapy as a loss of social status and feels
stigmatized.
Therapist Factors
As active participants, therapists bring their own values, skills, and motivation(s) to the treatment endeavor. All therapists, no matter which gender or
how many years of experience or training, potentially contribute to the therapeutic roadblocks. If you doubt this, you need only peruse the public record of
state licensing board disciplinary actions for evidence of misdeeds by licensed
psychologists. Not all the clinician-based roadblocks are at the level of misdeed.
Impediments to Change 355
Some are factors of experience and training. The therapist contributions to the
impediments include the following:
• The therapist lacks skills.
• The client and therapist maintain congruent distortions.
• The client has been poorly socialized by the therapist to the expectations
of the therapy or of a particular treatment model.
• The therapist is unable to build or communicate an active and effective
collaboration or working alliance. Essentially, the therapist has not gotten
informed consent and agreement with therapy goals.
• The therapist and the client are attempting to operate from an impaired or
limited database.
• The therapist has therapeutic narcissism.
• The therapist’s timing of interventions is poor.
• The therapist has limited skills but lacks experience.
• The therapy goals are unstated, unrealistic, or vague.
• The therapist fails to build and maintain the therapeutic bond.
• The therapist has a lack of understanding of the norms and of the developmental process.
• The therapist has unrealistic expectations of client.
Environmental Factors
We all live within a subgroup, a group, and a society. Each entity will have expectations and demands for conformity, allegiance, and contributions from the
client. Sometimes these demands will be in conflict; other times they may be in
direct opposition one to the other. The client’s difficulty may come from the
delicate balancing act of trying to meet the demands of many masters, and not
being able to do it. These psychosocial stressors would, ideally, be coded on the
DSM-IV-TR Axis IV. The demands of the environment could include:
• Environmental stressors that preclude change.
• Significant others (SOs) who foil or sabotage therapy.
• Agency or institutional reinforcement of pathology and illness through
compensation and benefits.
• Cultural opposition to help seeking.
• The maintenance of system homeostasis.
• Gross family pathology.
• Unrealistic demands on client by self and family members.
• Unrealistic demands on client by institutions.
• Financial factors that may limit the opportunities for change.
• Lack of resources or support from the environment.
• Resources with conflicting agendas for the client.
356 Basic Techniques for Clinicians—Intervention
Problem or Pathology Factors
Clients bring with them a plethora of factors. Some are related to the client’s
personal style as listed earlier. Other factors are indicative or diagnostic of the
client’s problems and pathology. These factors may be found in Axes I and II and
be part of the criteria for disorders coded on these axes. These could include:
• Rigid cognitive style.
• Significant medical or physiological problems.
• Trust impairments.
• Impulsivity and poor executive control.
• Cognitive impairment, confusion, or limited cognitive ability.
• Social isolation or alienation.
• Symptom profusion.
• Extreme dependence.
• Ongoing self devaluation.
• Limited energy for change.
• Substance misuse.
Client Factors
Lack of Skill to Comply with the Therapeutic Requirements or Regimen
Therapists cannot assume that every client has developed the skills to effectively perform a particular behavior or sequence of behaviors. For many
clients, their difficulty in therapy will parallel their inability to cope with life
stressors. Both may be based on inadequately developed skills. These skill
deficits may be broad (overall social skills) or more discrete (making eye contact while speaking to another person).
For many individuals, their present skill set has been adequate for getting
by in familiar and highly structured areas of life experience. In a novel situation, however, they have far more difficulty and may avoid it, when possible,
withdraw from it, or fail to meet its requirements. If they are overtly unsuccessful at coping, they may experience such a high level of discomfort that they
will avoid future encounters. Because these clients may never have developed
skills, or not developed them to the level necessary for adequate functioning,
the therapist may need to teach particular skills to help them move along in
therapy and thereby in life.
The assessment protocol must include an evaluation of the skill repertoire
of the individual including behavioral skills (e.g., acting in particular ways
when confronted with particular stimuli); cognitive skills (e.g., being able to
evaluate or dispute thoughts); situational skills (e.g., being able to leave situations that are potentially damaging); and affective skills (e.g., being able to control emotion). If there are skill deficits, the therapy must include the necessary
skill building. Whether this will be a major or minor component of the therapy
depends on the goals of the therapy.
Jim was a 26-year-old graduate student in clinical psychology. He reported for the first day of his clinical practicum wearing a tee shirt, cutoff jeans,
Impediments to Change 357
and sandals. When asked by the agency’s director of clinical training (DCT) why
he was dressed that way, Jim replied that it was a hot day and that this is what
he generally wore to school. When the DCT informed Jim that the agency had a
dress code for warm weather, Jim argued that he was the same person no matter what he wore and that dress codes were foolish and without value. When it
was emphasized to Jim that the dress code was not open for discussion or debate, he demanded to know what the DCT expected him to wear. The DCT
identified the sentence in the practicum student’s manual that stated that
practicum students were expected to dress “appropriately” and “professionally.” Jim asked what that meant. The DCT informed Jim that he had to wear
shoes, not sandals, long pants, a shirt with a collar and a tie, if he chose. Jim
agreed and left for the practicum student orientation meeting.
The next day Jim appeared at the agency wearing black shoes, yellow
socks, brown pants, a red shirt, and a green tie. On being informed of Jim’s outfit, the DCT called him into his office and demanded, “What is this? What sort
of outfit do you call this? Is this from a clown catalogue?” Jim seemed stunned.
He stammered, “I did what you said. I am wearing everything that you said that
I should.”
The DCT stopped and considered the following: Was Jim’s outfit the result
of passive aggression or simply a lack of social skills? He decided on the latter.
He asked Jim, “How did you choose this particular set of clothes to wear?” Jim
responded, “I guess I just took what was on the top of the clothes pile or what
was clean. What’s wrong with this?”
The DCT replied, “There are too many colors. They clash. In the future,
choose one or two colors and stay with them.” In a particularly poignant and
academic manner Jim asked, “Is there a book that I can read on how to dress?”
The next day, Jim came to the agency wearing black pants, black socks,
black shoes and a black shirt. He sought out the DCT to show his adherence to
one color.
Jim’s dress issues were the result of a lack of skills. By the end of the year,
with input from other students, Jim’s dress was far more conventional.
Ideas about Therapy Based on Previous Therapy Failure
Clients entering therapy will carry with them, perhaps in an overriding way,
their experience in a previous therapy or the cumulative impact of therapeutic
experiences that they view as failures. When clients have cognitions of failing
to make changes in thought or behavior, the therapist needs to help the client
carefully examine their ideas of what succeeded in the past, what they see as
failed, and what they would like to accomplish in the present work. It is essential that the therapist does not label the previous therapy as failing, but rather
as clients’ further attempts or steps taken toward succeeding. Examining the
client’s underlying assumptions and reactions to the previous therapy will be an
important first step in building the new therapy.
An aspect of failure that inhibits many clients is their rumination about
the previous therapist’s reactions and if the previous therapist considered that
the client did the therapy “right.” Rather than trying to interpret the previous
therapist’s reaction, it would be far more adaptive to examine the client’s views
of others. If the client anticipates receiving harsh criticism, anger, expressions
of disappointment, or other aversive responses from the therapist, it may be
358 Basic Techniques for Clinicians—Intervention
useful to bring the question into the here-and-now. Does the client expect criticism and failure in the present therapy? Do they wait for the inevitable criticism? Are they waiting for their pink slip firing them from therapy... again?
It is important for the therapist to respond to this impediment without
being punitive or authoritarian and instead to work with the client to understand what blocked compliance. However, it is also important for the therapist
to be alert for negative anticipation based on the client’s previous experience
with parents and teachers and to address these explicitly if they impede therapy. Homework is an area in which clients’ negative expectations often emerge.
Their fear is that if they fail to do it, they will be thrown out of therapy. Perfectionist clients often anticipate extreme reactions if they don’t do homework
perfectly, and it can be useful to address these anticipations early in therapy.
Usually it is possible to honestly present the client’s task as a “no-lose” situation by pointing out incidents of noncompliance or unexpected results that
provide opportunities for making valuable discoveries. The therapist might follow the first homework assignment with, “One of the nice things about this sort
of approach is that whatever happens, we come out ahead. If you go ahead and
do [the assignment] and it goes the way we expect, great! We’re making progress toward your goals. If you unexpectedly cannot get yourself to do it or if it
does not work out the way we expect, then we have an opportunity to look at
what happened and at your thoughts and feelings to discover more about what
blocks you from your goals. If it goes smoothly, we’re making progress and if it
doesn’t, we’re making a discovery.” For many clients this greatly reduces the
fear of failure.
Ellen, aged 35, came to therapy after having been in therapy for 3 years
with her previous therapist. She had a list of therapists that went back to age
14. At that point, she was referred because of bulimic purging once or twice a
week. The therapist had Ellen placed on an inpatient psychiatry unit for 3
weeks. Afterward, she was seen twice weekly for 3 years. Ellen’s bulimia was
reduced to once a month. She could control it but frequently thought about
purging.
Over the past several years, she sought therapy to get rid of the thinking,
and the monthly binge-purge experience. In seeking the present therapy, she
started with the challenge, “No one has gotten me to stop this. Part of me is
hopeful that this time I will be successful, but part of me believes that this will
fail like all of the other times.”
Fears That Others Will Be Hurt or Impacted in a Negative Way
Sometimes, clients fear that change will have a negative impact or cause damage to significant others. These clients view the result or consequences of their
changing as a catastrophe and need not only to decatastrophize the potential,
but to examine whether there are possible advantages to changing. In many
cases, their negative view is either gained from a significant other or is more
subtly reinforced. A client’s family may see growing independence as a way of
drifting away from the family. The family will then offer the view that the
client’s changes are damaging individuals (“You’re killing me”), the family system (“Your actions are breaking up the family”), or will be damaging to the
client (“You don’t realize how good you have it now”).
Impediments to Change 359
Clients can be helped to examine and discuss (a) the explicit and implicit
messages that they get from others; (b) the content, feeling tone, and timing of
these messages; (c) the implications of what others attribute to the client’s
change; and (d) advantages and disadvantages of change both within and without the system of significant others. As therapists, we should be careful not to
try to challenge the “others” directly as the older (and more powerful) allegiances and alliances may come back to haunt us.
Marsha, aged 19, came to the college counseling center without an appointment. She was in tears and was seen immediately by a staff psychologist.
Marsha opened up quickly and described a crying/screaming/threatening experience at her home. She had agreed with her parents to spend the first year of
college at a local campus of the state university system and to live at home to
“save money.” Her plan for subsequent years was to then transfer to the main
campus of the state university and live on campus.
Money is not the issue, she told the therapist. My folks have lots of money.
We have a big house, my mom and dad both drive Mercedes, and we have a
full-time housekeeper. “My mother is afraid that if I were to move out to go to
college, she would never see me again. That I would graduate and move to the
moon. She is very frightened of being alone. She fears that my dad will die, I’ll
be away, and then she’ll have nobody.”
“How does that make you feel” asked the counselor. “Guilty, bad, wrong,
stupid, ungrateful, and uncaring” said Marsha. “If I go away to college, my
mother will die. I just know that she will waste away and die.”
Secondary Gain from Maintaining Symptoms
In some situations, clients may not change because of the gain that accrues
from continuing their dysfunctional thinking or behavior. In the case of suicidal
behavior or ideation, this can force family members to treat the client gently,
not put any pressure on the client, avoid confrontation, and generally allow the
client to do whatever the person wishes, rather than increase the suicidal potential. This gain may be gotten from family, friends, employers, or other individuals with whom the client has interaction.
The client needs to look at the primary loss that goes into achieving their
secondary gain. When possible, the client needs to be helped to obtain their
gain in other ways. If the gain is powerful enough, therapists may find themselves stymied in the head-to-head confrontation. The Socratic dialogue is most
helpful at this point. This directive dialogue can help the client to find a perspective that is far more powerful at limiting the perceived gain than simply
being told by the therapist to consider the liabilities.
Allen, aged 44, lived at home with his parents. He did not work and he
slept until 11:00 A.M. each day. Allen had no responsibilities at home. His
mother cooked all meals, cleaned up afterward, and washed his clothes. When
his father tried to have Allen do things around the house (gardening, cleaning)
Allen refused stating, “I’m not your slave.”
When asked to contribute money to the house for food, Allen refused stating, “It’s your job to take care of me. You abused me as a kid and now you have
to pay it back.” When pressed, Allen would run to the basement of the house,
stand on a chair, place a rope around a beam in the basement and then around
360 Basic Techniques for Clinicians—Intervention
his neck and threaten to hang himself. His parents were so frightened of his
possible suicide that they gave in to all his requests.
Allen sounds like a 13-year-old in the body of a 44-year-old. This being
how the therapist saw the situation, the recommendation was for family therapy to help Allen but also to try to maintain the contingencies for his behavior
at home by working with his parents as one would do with an adolescent.
Fear of Change or Becoming Different
For some clients, change means giving up ideas, beliefs of behaviors that they
see as inimical to their survival. This may seem paradoxical because it is their
thinking that keeps them stuck. In reality, these clients fear any change because
of the unknown and therefore threatening element. The familiarity of their
pain is preferable to the uncertainty of a new mode of thinking or behaving.
More simply, they believe “The devil that you know is better than the devil that
you don’t know.”
As with many fears, the first approach is to gather as much data as possible, including the client’s perception of the effort needed to change, the possibility of successful change, the impact of change, the client’s ability to cope
with change, and the price that the client believes must be paid for change.
Henry, 52, came to therapy at the referral of his physician. He was told
that he had to slow down and reduce the stress on his body (especially his
heart) from his 16-hour workdays, 6 or 7 days a week. Henry rarely took vacations and spent very little time with his wife or children. This had been his
pattern since he was 12. He worked a paper route, cleaned up in a meat market at the end of the day, and worked nights in his father’s pharmacy while
studying and graduating with a scholarship to college. At college, he went to
classes, worked in the university library, and worked 2 nights a week in a
local pharmacy.
His expressed concern was that everyone (his wife, the doctor) was trying
to turn him into a “typical working slob.” Who could be successful working 9
to 5? He credited his financial and professional success to his long hours of
working without distraction. He did not know what it would be like to work
less.
Therapy focused on his incrementally and experimentally reducing various activities. The goal was not to stop, but to evaluate what would happen if
he turned down the intensity of his activity and allowed some time to relax and
connect with others.
Lack of Compelling Reasons to Change
Clients may be experiencing some discomfort with the impact of their behavior,
yet are still comfortable with the behavior. Often, clients see small parts of the
problems but view these issues as “part of them,” or as too small to bother with
in therapy. There is no compelling reason to consider a personal change, and
there may even be strong reasons the client wishes to avoid change. Clients may
also come for therapy under protest. The therapy may be mandated as part of a
legal penalty (“go to therapy or go to jail”) or coerced by family members (“If
you don’t get help, I’m leaving you”). For child and adolescent clients, the referral will come from the school or parents (“You are in trouble and must
change what you are doing, now”).
Impediments to Change 361
In these circumstances, clients come to therapy with the message that the
therapist is an agent of the referring (or coercive) individual, whether that individual is parent, spouse, judge, probation officer, guidance counselor, or
teacher. This sets up a negative and possibly adversarial situation prior to the
first therapy session.
Helping clients to identify the advantages and disadvantages of being involved in therapy can help generate motivation and reasons to consider change.
A second technique would be to have the client examine and to entertain the
possibility of some value to changing, no matter how small that possibility
might be.
Clients often accept identifying the value, gain, profit, advantage, merit,
desirability, or benefit no matter how minimal. The motivation can be extrinsic
or intrinsic. The extrinsic motive may be to stay out of jail, to have a parent or
probation officer “get off of their back,” or to profit in financial ways. The goal
of the intervention is to have the client agree to therapy for whatever period of
time is appropriate or mandated. The question the therapist asks is, “How might
this work to your advantage?” Or, “How can therapy work in your enlightened
self-interest?”
A final technique is to work in therapy time modules. A therapy module
can be from 1 to 10 sessions. This strategy removes the therapy from the realm
of forever and makes it into a more proximal and workable time frame. The
goals for each module are specified and limited.
Erik, aged 15, was brought to therapy by his parents in an attempt to help
him be more cooperative at home. Erik did not want to be in therapy, had little
to say in therapy, and believed that the therapist was part of the adult conspiracy to punish him for speaking his mind. Erik’s first action was to shock the
therapist by his language. Every other word Erik uttered seemed to be a fourletter one, interspersed liberally with other sexual references. Rather than challenging Erik (“Watch your mouth young man”) or joining him (“Sure, I can see
that coming here is a f g waste of your f g time and f g effort,”) the therapist stated the obvious. “Speaking this way at home has the goal
and effect of getting your parents upset and annoyed. It won’t have that effect
or impact on me.” Erik eventually slowed down his attempts to upset the therapist when the therapist kept asking, “What can I do to help get your folks off
your back?”
General Negative Set toward Therapy
Often clients seem to have a “bad attitude,” or “a very negative view.” What is
labeled as attitudinal is often an issue of negative set. The negative set might be
manifested directly as “Yes-but” behavior by being agreeable and then quickly
disqualifying whatever the therapist says, or directly arguing with the therapist
on issues both large and small.
When dealing with a client with a negative set, it is essential that the therapist refrain from being drawn in debates, arguments, or tautological discussions that do not enhance the therapy. Given the negative set, the therapist can
help to develop a positive cognitive set in otherwise resistant clients. The protocol involves several steps.
First, use Socratic questioning rather than interpretation. This involves a
process of guided discovery. By the careful placement of simple closed-ended
362 Basic Techniques for Clinicians—Intervention
questions, the client can be moved slowly toward a more positive view. While
the temptation may be to use open-ended questions to keep the therapy
moving, the closed-end questioning keeps stress low in the interview.
The client only has to answer relatively easy questions. This may preclude
having the client develop an opening for ongoing venting of their upset with
the world.
In framing the questions, the therapist has to be careful to state them so
that the answer is affirmative. The rule is that the therapist does not move
ahead unless and until they receive an affirmative response:
Poor question: Do you want to be here?
Better question: Are there many other places you would rather be?
Poor question: Do you believe that they treated you (fairly; well; appropriately)?
Better question: I would guess that you believe that they treated you (unfairly;
poorly; inappropriately) is that so?
If the client offers a negative response, immediately reframe it so that the
new question will elicit a positive response:
Therapist: “Do you think that you had any responsibility for what happened?”
Client: “No. None.”
Therapist: “So what happened was, in your view, due to what others did. Is that
what you are saying?”
The basic idea is that the content of the interview with the negative client
is secondary to the purpose of reducing resistance and increasing rapport.
When this technique is used, clients will see the therapist as more on their side,
more agreeable, and less threatening. Once the negative set is shifted, more traditional therapeutic tools can be used.
Maria came from a home where she was always questioned, and every
choice that she made was challenged. She married Brad who (not surprisingly)
questioned and challenged every choice that she made. She worked in an office
at the university where her boss questioned and challenged every choice that
she made. Her children, modeling their father, questioned and challenged every
choice that she made or rule that she set or tried to enforce.
Her referral for therapy came from her family physician, who was treating
her pharmacologically for depression. Despite her physician’s encouragement,
Maria came to therapy with a negative set which was voiced as, “There is nothing that anyone can do to help me. I’m beyond help. I can’t do anything right. I
have always been this way and I deserve what I get. That’s what everyone says,
my folks, my husband, even my kids.”
The initial focus of therapy was to use the questioning with a positive response to help Maria to begin to relate more positively in therapy, to begin to
chip away at the negative cognitive set, and have her see that there might be possibilities for change in her life.
Impediments to Change 363
Limited Ability for Self-Monitoring of Thoughts, Feelings, and Behavior
Individuals may see the flaws and foibles of others but be blind to their own.
The difficulty or, in some cases, the inability to self-monitor will often cause
major problems in life, and be a major stumbling block for therapy. Being either
unaware of the need to self-monitor or unable to self-monitor can have a range
of effects for the individual. These individuals may say or do things that others
view as strange or bizarre. By virtue of not self-monitoring, they may find
themselves in deep difficulty with work, or with interpersonal or intrapersonal
issues. By not attending to their internal or external environments, they may,
in the words of the popular saying, “be up to their eyeballs in alligators.” The
inability to accurately self-evaluate can lead to depressive affect and behavior
that in turn distorts clients’ ability to accurately self-monitor. When depressed,
they do not self-monitor but rather self-devaluate with negative appraisals
and attributions.
Clients who do not self-monitor their more grandiose movements may
find themselves out on a limb by virtue of involving themselves in projects
or schemes that are far beyond their ability to satisfy. Rather than selfdevaluation, this client’s reflections are more self-serving and preserving of
their positive self-image, even if reality is underrepresented.
The broad goal of intervention is to help clients develop a productive selfmonitoring style. A major part of that goal involves the development of an observant style. If an individual has surveyed the scene and still decides to move
ahead with a project or action, we can assume that it is not necessarily their
self-monitoring that is flawed, but their problem-solving ability.
Jim, the psychology student described earlier, had to self-monitor what he
wore, not merely wearing what was available or clean. He had to plan ahead for
those days that he was at the practicum site. What started as a way of avoiding
problems became a more global attempt to fit into a new professional role.
Limited or Poor Ability to Monitor the Responses and Reactions of Others
Monitoring of others is a problem that often goes hand in hand with poor selfmonitoring. These clients look at others, may even be preoccupied with them,
but actually see little. Their response to others is based on images, projections,
and distortions rather than a data-based assessment. Others appear to be
brighter, more attractive, more skilled, and so on. All other relationships must
be more rewarding than any they have or might have. Others, quite simply, are
not seen in terms of their realistic human needs, limits, and vulnerabilities.
Interventions, both in the sessions and as homework, need to focus on
practice in observing others. This may take place as an observer in a mall,
restaurant, or store. Subtly and carefully observing others is good practice. Observing and estimating the specific response of significant others can be a useful homework assignment. Even gauging and predicting the therapist’s reaction
to certain stimuli can be used. Group work can be useful to help clients with
this problem.
Gretchen had become convinced that she lived in a different social world
than everyone else. She avoided going out very much because she expected
people to look at her “funny” because she was alone in public. She believed that
most people had lots of friends and relatives to share activities with and that it
364 Basic Techniques for Clinicians—Intervention
was abnormal to do anything alone. When she had to travel about on her own,
she felt very conspicuous and perceived herself as a focus of attention, no matter how quietly she behaved. Examining her perceptions in the context of a
therapy session had little impact on Gretchen’s degree of conviction in her view
of self and the world. Gretchen’s therapist proposed an experiment to test some
of these perceptions by meeting for a session at a coffee shop. They arrived separately, and the therapist observed Gretchen for the first 15 minutes as she ordered coffee and sat alone reading a book. Then the therapist joined Gretchen
and together they discussed her experiences and observed others in the coffee
shop. Gretchen wondered whether people were looking at her funny, but she
had not actually seen anyone staring. The therapist offered a reliability check to
this perception with her observation that Gretchen has drawn no particular attention from the other patrons. Gretchen surveyed the scene and observed an
assortment of other people in the coffee shop, some in pairs, a couple of
groups, and several people enjoying their beverage alone, disconfirming her notion that it was abnormal to go anywhere in public alone.
A Demanding Interpersonal Style
Highly demanding or self-centered interpersonal behavior may reflect a narcissistic personality style. This needs to be differentiated from a diagnosis of clinical
narcissism, which is a more pervasive and severe impairment in interpersonal
relationships. The narcissistic style causes these clients to be so self-involved that
any attempt to have them look at others or at themselves is met with resistance.
The reaction is typically framed as, “The problem can’t be me,” or “Why would
you (or anyone) expect so much from me.” What is problematic is that the demanding style is often reinforced by having others accede to their wishes or
demands.
It is essential for the therapist to set clear limits early in therapy. Once set,
these limits must be maintained until restated or purposely renegotiated and
changed. The use of self-instruction and assessing with the client the value of
the demanding style can be discussed.
By virtue of luck, personal charm, good looks, and a demanding style, Sal
had become used to getting his needs met without question. He came to therapy as an alternative to jail after he was caught and convicted of selling stolen
property. Sal maintained that he did not know that the property was stolen, but
despite his charm, he was convicted. His style in therapy was to ask for favors:
“Do I really have to come every week? After all, if I come every other week, the
judge wouldn’t know, right?” He smiled, complimented the office décor, the
therapist’s suit, and the therapist’s credentials. He voiced how lucky he was to
be seeing the therapist. When his charm did not work, Sal pouted: “How can
you do this to me? From what I remember from school, therapists are supposed
to meet their client’s needs.” When this did not work, Sal switched back to
charm. When this did not work, Sal became sad because he was being “misunderstood” by the therapist.
Low Tolerance for Frustration and Unrealistic Expectations
Clients may have unrealistic expectations of therapy and possible therapy progress. When the expectations are not met, clients may blame themselves or the
therapist for the lack of progress. They may respond to their frustration by
Impediments to Change 365
withdrawing, withholding from the therapeutic collaboration, or terminating
therapy.
If, at the outset of therapy, there are discrete goals and realistic change criteria, the progress of therapy can be assessed and monitored. Without these,
the client can easily see no progress and may prematurely foreclose the effort.
Bill’s expectation or demand was that the therapy should take no more
than 10 sessions. He had read an article about therapy and it stated that more
than 10 sessions was unnecessary. To support his argument, he pointed to the
limited sessions that were being paid for by insurance companies. “After all,” he
said, “if these multimillion dollar companies have studied therapy and concluded that it should only take ten sessions, I expect that from you.”
Therapy Perceived as a Loss of Social Status
For some individuals, being in therapy, for whatever reason, is a mark of lowered status. Being in therapy is the mark of being “sick,” “disturbed,” “weird,”
“a nut case,” or “crazy.” Given the belief that being in therapy equates with
being flawed, it would follow that fighting therapy (or the therapist), leaving, or
avoiding therapy makes one less flawed. This is especially true in working with
children and adolescents who are invariably sent, brought, or threatened into
therapy. They then see the therapist as another adult, which emphasizes their
helplessness.
Clients can be helped to reframe their position as one of taking greater
control. In fact, the goal of the therapy will be for them to take control over
those areas and circumstances that are reasonable, and to work at coping with
those situations that are less controllable. The therapy must be framed to raise
their position rather than to indicate their helplessness or low position. It is in
this regard that the therapeutic collaboration, the therapeutic bond, and a clear
working alliance are essential.
Maria, described earlier, saw her client status as proving that there was
something wrong with her. It was essential for her to fight the therapy and the
therapist to prove that she would not submit in this arena, too. By reframing
the therapy as a way for Maria to gain skills that she could use at home, with
her folks, with her boss, and with her children, she could agree to be part of the
collaboration. The metaphor that was helpful for Maria was that therapy was a
cast and a crutch for a broken leg. Both would be useful until there was sufficient healing of broken bones. These would not be needed when her leg was
strong enough to support her.
Therapist Factors
Lack of Therapist Skill
Just as clients come into therapy with a particular set of skills, so, too, do therapists. Because of limited experience with a particular client problem or population, the therapist may not be best equipped to work with a particular client.
The therapist working within the context of an agency or hospital setting may
call in colleagues for consultation on the case or seek supervision on a particular case or problem. It is incumbent on therapists to constantly develop, enhance, and upgrade their skills through additional training. Postgraduate
courses, continuing education programs, seminars, workshops, or institutes are
366 Basic Techniques for Clinicians—Intervention
part of the professional growth of all therapists. If the therapist’s skills are a
poor match with the client’s problem, transfer to another therapist is the ethical
indication.
Students often have the disadvantage of seeing clients with extensive histories of psychological problems. This occurs at a time when the student is just
learning about the range of problems and skills. However, the development of
professional skills is a career-long endeavor, and students can expect to continually expand their fund of knowledge and range of skills. There is a spectrum of
skill development efforts that professionals can use for the duration of their career, from student to seasoned practitioner. At one end of the spectrum is information seeking. This can involve reading of texts or other books, or searching the
literature and Internet for information. Another tool is self-supervision where therapists review their session notes and tapes, and do their own supervision or consultation. Peer consultation can be useful when therapists meet with colleagues to
support and instruct each other. A therapist confronted by a particular client type
or client problem may seek professional consultation on an as-needed basis for a single meeting or for a limited number of consultation sessions. The therapist may
also choose an ongoing professional supervision or consultation where the discussion
is not limited but part of an overall professional growth experience.
For students, there is always required ongoing professional supervision that is
part of professional training requirements and necessary to avoid unlawful
practice without a license and potential risks to the client. Where the supervisor’s experience is limited, additional professional consultation might be sought for
a specific area of concern. For many psychologists, an integrative approach is
used. This includes professional supervision, peer consultation, and selfsupervision. Finally, therapists who are experiencing difficulty in dealing with
a particular client, client type, or client problem, may find that personal therapy
helps them cope, and consultation on risk management may be advisable.
Congruent Distortions Maintained by Client and Therapist
Therapists’ blind spots may be very destructive to the therapeutic process in
that they generally incline the therapist to accept the client’s dysfunctional beliefs without question. If a client and therapist share a particular dysfunctional
idea (e.g., “everything is hopeless and cannot change”; “all men or women cannot be trusted”), it will bode poorly for the therapy. This sharing of an idea or
belief can result in the therapist buying into the client’s hopeless ideas and beliefs, not testing these beliefs, and even encouraging them.
Therapists must be exquisitely tuned into their personal life issues. Without this awareness, they may be blindsided by a client’s revelation or comment.
Whether this awareness comes from personal therapy or self-examination is of
lesser consequence. Whenever we accept the client’s statements as being unassailable we as therapists surrender our ability to help. While it is always appropriate to empathize with the client, the therapist must be able to go further and
ask, “What are we going to do about it?”
Sue, aged 27, sought therapy for her depression. She described her depression to her therapist Alicia as based on the fact that despite everything that
she and her husband were doing, Sue could not get pregnant. She described her
desperate wish for a baby, a desire that she stated went back to her adolescence.
Impediments to Change 367
“Being a mother has always been more important than school, degrees, jobs, or
anything else.”
In supervision, Alicia described her goals of helping Sue to (a) come to
terms with her inability to conceive a child, (b) view herself as a woman despite her inability to conceive, (c) not be angry at her husband for his inability
to help her conceive, (d) reduce her anger at her husband for not understanding
the depth of her upset and trying to placate her. When the supervisor tried to
gather more data from Alicia about everything that Sue had done, Alicia stated,
“She’s done everything!”
“So, the fertility clinic here at the university has written her off?” The supervisor asked.
“I guess so” replied Alicia. When the supervisor persisted, Alicia became
angry and told him that she did not expect a man to fully understand Sue’s loss.
Alicia thought the supervisor was being sexist and ignorant of the issues, and
that she (Alicia) did not want to continue the discussion of Sue. When the supervisor persisted and asked Alicia to stay with the issue just a while longer,
Alicia said, “I can’t.” She began crying and after a period of soothing revealed
the following. Her two children were adopted. This was not known to her peers
or coworkers. Alicia was unable to get pregnant, an issue that ultimately
caused stress in her marriage and contributed to the ending of that relationship.
She had never questioned whether Sue had sought fertility treatment but went
immediately to trying to soothe Sue.
When Alicia questioned Sue further, she discovered that Sue had never
sought fertility treatment. Alicia and Sue shared the idea, “I cannot ever get
pregnant,” that might have been true for Alicia but not necessarily for Sue.
Failure to Adequately Socialize Client to Treatment
Clients who do not understand what is expected of them will have difficulty complying with the therapeutic regimen. It is essential that the therapist assess the
level of understanding of the goals and guidelines for therapy generally and for the
specific model throughout the therapy work. Often clients’ very problems may impair their ability to listen and understand. Hundreds of self-help books are available but these rarely if ever explain the role of being a client. The therapist cannot
assume that having read books about therapy provides adequate socialization to
therapy generally, or to a particular model specifically. Further, there may be
proactive interference because of ideas from readings or previous therapy. Clients
who have been in therapy have, ideally, been socialized to that previous therapy
model. They will continue to use the same strategies and approach to therapy and
to life in general unless and until they are taught to respond differently.
Milt, aged 66, had psychoanalysis sessions 3 times per week for 14 years
with the same analyst. When the analyst died, Milt spent the next year and half
shopping for a new analyst to replace his lost friend. “He knew everything about
me, I called him by his first name, sent him Christmas cards.” After an unsuccessful search where Milt either interviewed therapists or started trial therapy,
he decided that his analyst could not be replaced and that he would have to settle for a “lesser” therapy. This brought him to a therapist that had been recommended highly as an expert in the treatment of depression. After a two-session
interview of the therapist, Milt decided to enter treatment. He reported that the
368 Basic Techniques for Clinicians—Intervention
reason that he sought therapy over 15 years earlier was to treat his depression.
When asked if that was done in the analytic work Milt said, “No, but I liked
going.”
The new therapist was careful to not, in any way, question what was done
in the previous therapy. When Milt came to each new session, he would start to
engage in free association. When it was pointed out that this new therapy used
a more focused approach, Milt heard that as critical of his previous therapy.
Milt and the new therapist negotiated an agreement to put free association on
the agenda as the first item. This would last for no more than ten minutes, and
that was followed by agenda setting and a more focused approach to therapy. It
is the therapist’s job to make sure that the client is aware of the requirements,
expectations, special circumstances, and goals of the therapy and to negotiate a
satisfactory working alliance.
Inability to Build an Active and Effective Collaboration
Collaboration is an essential ingredient for all psychotherapy. If the client and
therapist do not have a good working alliance, it would follow that the client
may be less motivated to work with the therapist, do homework, follow the
therapist’s direction, or generally work toward making changes. The lack of collaboration, if not based on socialization difficulty or the skill of the therapist,
may be due to the client’s thoughts about cooperation or collaboration. Certain
clients may actively thwart the therapist. This type of passive-aggressive behavior may be motivated by any of a variety of client ideation; issues of control, entitlement, fear, competition or displaced anger may all cause difficulty in the
therapy. This client may be directly challenging or more covertly avoidant as in
the classic “yes, but” response.
A therapist in training asked for advice in handling a client’s noncompliance with behavioral experiments designed to reduce the client’s perfectionism. The client’s goals for therapy were to resolve some relatively minor marital
problems, but the therapist saw the client’s perfectionism and the stress and job
dissatisfaction that resulted from it as more significant. Rather than discussing
this issue with the client and reaching an agreement on the goals of therapy,
the therapist had unilaterally begun working on perfectionism and this led to
the noncompliance.
Collaboration involves both the therapist and the client and either of them
can disrupt it. If the client feels that he or she has no voice in how therapy proceeds, either because this is indeed the case or because of his or her beliefs and
expectations, this is likely to interfere with collaboration and produce problems
with compliance. It is important for the therapist to actively solicit and value
the client’s input in setting agendas, determining the focus of therapy, and developing homework assignments, particularly with clients who tend to be
unassertive. It is also important to be alert for any client thoughts that could
block collaboration.
An Attempt to Operate from an Impaired or Limited Database
We have stressed that the basis for therapy is the assessment and general collection of data. The therapeutic conceptualization and treatment plan is then data
based. If the therapy is focused on theory without data, the therapy will suffer.
Impediments to Change 369
The therapist may then make major conceptual leaps without a solid footing on
which to base the interventions.
The therapist must always be searching for data and, as a function of the
therapy, help the client to become an effective data collector. Questions such as,
“What value does that have for you?” “What meaning do you give that?”
“What exactly did he say?” or, “Let’s go over the process step by step?” all direct
the client toward collecting and evaluating the data instead of responding to bits
and pieces of it. In working with individuals or couples, an effective data-gathering question subsequent to something being said or done within the session
is, “What just happened right here?” This directs the client(s) to the here-andnow.
Homework, an important part of the overall therapy, is designed to help
the client gather data.
Ray, aged 42 came to therapy as a facet of his ongoing difficulty with his
wife. She had returned to school to pursue an associate’s degree in nursing.
When Ray and Judith married 20 years earlier, she dropped out of school to
work at home and to raise their two children. They were now aged 17 and 15,
and Judith felt that it was a good time for her to return to school.
Ray, on the other hand, was used to having his dinner ready for him when
he came home from work and was very upset that Judith wasn’t around. She
was in classes, studying, and involved in clinical experiences. A crisis emerged
when Judith informed Ray that she and several other students would be funded
by the college to attend the state nursing conference a month hence. Ray came
for therapy very upset. “What am I to do? I’ll be home alone.” For the 20 years
of their marriage, the only time that Ray and Judith had spent a night away
from each other was when she gave birth.
Ray’s thoughts were like a runaway train. “She’ll like going to the conference. Now she’ll start going to all of these conferences. There are many
throughout the year. She’ll be away a lot.” When asked if that was what Judith
said, that she was going to go to one conference a month, and that she would
be away a minimum of a weekend a month, Ray said no. “She’s going to this
conference.” This observation immediately slowed the racing of his thoughts
and the distress in his mood. Looking at the data had a marked impact on slowing his runaway emotional train.
Therapeutic Narcissism
An issue that can be a major impediment to change is what we term “therapeutic narcissism.” This results from therapists being so taken with themselves and
their therapeutic approach that they are blinded to the need for greater humanity, empathy, and depth.
Therapeutic narcissism may take the form of telling rather than asking
clients how they feel. It may show up in several other ways: deciding what the
client needs without consulting the client, believing that change should take
less time than it does, setting goals for change that are distal and grandiose, or
labeling clients as resistant for continuing to believe the dysfunctional ideas
taught to them by parents and significant others. Therapeutic narcissists believe
they are more powerful than they really are, smarter than they really are, that
they know what the client is “really” thinking, that they never have to accept
370 Basic Techniques for Clinicians—Intervention
the germ of truth in a client’s negative comments and that simply spending time
in their aura should be therapeutic.
Pat was a psychology intern. He was very bright and very verbal. He
claimed to be an advocate for a short-term rational emotive behavior (REBT)
model of treatment that used debate and persuasion as a major therapeutic
tool. What was clear about Pat’s work was that it was short term. Most of his
clients were seen for one session. In that session Pat would quickly identify the
problem, enter a debate with the client and by the end of the session, the client
would admit that Pat was right. The client rarely returned for another session.
Pat’s view was that if they did not return than they were either cured or not
ready to hear the “truth.”
Poor Timing of Interventions
Untimely interventions may cause clients to miss the importance or relevance
of the therapeutic work, and thereby appear to be noncompliant. If the therapist, because of anxiety, tries to push or rush the client, the result may be the
loss of collaboration, the missing of sessions, a misunderstanding of the therapeutic issues, or a premature termination of therapy, a possibly fatal issue with
a hopeless client.
If the therapist misses an opportune moment for an intervention, it is
far better to let it go and return when the moment is once again opportune.
Trying to place an intervention when the timing is wrong may obscure the
value and purpose of an otherwise excellent option. Given that problems and
issues do not disappear in a day, there will be other times for the therapist to
use that tactic.
Chris, a therapy intern, saw an opportunity to use a metaphor in the first
session of the therapy. When he did, the client looked at him and said that he
considered the therapist’s statement condescending and inappropriate. Further,
he thought that an apology was due him. Rather than enter into a power struggle with the client, Chris apologized if anything that he said upset the client.
The same metaphor, used several sessions later, was not only accepted but
prompted the client to say that he had not been ready to see what the therapist
was pointing out in the earlier session.
Lack of Experience
This impediment exists because everyone starting something new is inexperienced. This impediment is unintentional and a standard part of the mental
health training system. The front-line therapists working with the most disturbed and problematic clients may be the therapists in practicum, internship,
or residency settings. The key for the therapist with limited experience is ongoing supervision.
The attainment of the state license in psychology allows the psychologist
to function independently. However, this typically requires at least 1 year of
postdoctoral supervised experience. Even though the newly minted therapist
may feel ready to practice independently, the practitioners overall professional
judgment is developed over time within the more protected confines of supervision and regular consultation.
Impediments to Change 371
Unstated, Unrealistic, or Vague Goals
When the goals of therapy are unstated, unrealistic, or vague, the client may
unknowingly resist the treatment. The client’s problem list must be clearly and
explicitly set out and then ordered in terms of the priorities of the therapy. This
prioritization must be realistic rather than idealistic.
The client who does not understand and agree to what is expected will
have difficulty complying with the therapeutic regimen. It is easy for therapists
to overlook that clients have not understood and accepted their instructions and
explanations. It is important for the therapist to repeatedly solicit feedback
from the client and to encourage the client to raise any concerns and objections, so that therapist and client can develop a shared understanding of the
client’s problems which forms a basis for collaboration and so that it is clear
that the client understands and accepts the homework assignments. Generally
this proves to be sufficient, but when the client holds strong preconceptions
about therapy, the therapist may need to compromise to some extent to facilitate collaboration. This issue also raises problems with informed consent.
Clients must be part of the treatment planning process and informed as to the
goals, strategies, and interventions of the therapy so that they can best comply
rather than being noncompliant out of ignorance.
Inability to Build and Maintain the Therapeutic Bond
In the interest of providing technical interventions and producing rapid results,
many contemporary therapists overlook the importance and primacy of the
therapeutic bond. Just taking time to get to know the client and developing rapport, understanding, and a feeling of familiarity may feel entirely too passive
or underproductive. The eager therapist wants to get going and do something
to help the client. However, the client may feel very uncomfortable with this
technique-oriented therapy and thus be a reluctant participant. There are many
reasons the therapist may lapse in this particular endeavor, including an underestimation of the importance of the therapeutic bond, time pressure from
managed care, difficulty relating to diverse clients, therapeutic narcissism, or
difficulty in tolerating the emotional aspects of this professional role.
Brandon took a very businesslike approach with all his therapy clients.
There is nothing inherently wrong with this strategy, except that Brandon
tended to come across to clients as cold and mechanical. He had little to say to
any individual client, and he focused on writing notes and directing “exercises”
during each session. One client even remarked on a feedback form that Brandon seemed to have a “preprogrammed” approach to therapy that made the experience feel very impersonal. It was no surprise that Brandon had an
extremely short turnaround time in his case-load.
Poor Understanding of Developmental Norms and Developmental Process
An understanding of developmental process including the works of Piaget and
Erikson are essential ingredients in assessment, conceptualization, treatment
planning, and interventions.
Starting with the notion of individuals developing schemas as templates
for understanding and responding to the world, the therapist must focus on the
372 Basic Techniques for Clinicians—Intervention
stages of cognitive development (sensorimotor, preoperational, concrete operations, and formal operations) that can be observed most clearly in the pathological presentations of clients with personality disorders.
Although we expect that adults have achieved the stage of formal operations, this is not always the case. This will assist in the matching of therapeutic
interventions to the client’s level of cognitive development. Having a developmental focus also helps therapists understand the clients’ evolution of schema
in terms of their psychosocial development.
Allen, discussed earlier, was an adult only in years on earth. In every
other way he was an adolescent. In fact, he was an oppositional-defiant adolescent. To try to treat him in individual therapy would be of limited value in that,
like most adolescents, Allen saw his parents as the source of all his frustration.
When Allen was asked why he stayed in such a stressful setting, Allen’s response was, “What do you expect me to do, leave my home?”
Unrealistic Expectations of the Client
One of the subsets of therapeutic narcissism is having expectations of clients
that are more in line with ideal change and out of the realm of reality.
The clients, their families, and even the therapist may believe that a total
change is what is needed for the client. Whether this is realistic based on the
long-term nature of the client’s problems must be an overriding part of the
treatment plan.
Estelle, aged 45, came for therapy to “finally get her life together.” She
described over 30 years of therapy with many therapists in many different
settings. She described episodes of severe depression, multiple hospitalizations, self-injurious behavior, suicide attempts, poor work history, poor school
performance, few relationships, and estrangement from her family. She was
supported by SSI (government subsidy) and lived in a room that she rented by
the week.
Her therapy goals within a year were to have a job that she liked, earn
enough money to buy a house, begin dating, establish a love relationship, possibly adopt “some” children, restore her relationship with her parents and sister, no longer be depressed, and no longer want to hurt herself. The therapist’s
statement, “We can start to work on all of these,” set up an expectation that Estelle had the skills, the ongoing motivation, and the supports to do any of them.
Before moving ahead, it would be prudent for the therapist to assess what is
possible, what is probable, and what may not be realistic.
Environmental Factors
Environmental Stressors Precluding Change
Factors in the client’s environment may maintain their psychopathology. There
may be family schemas that mediate against the client making changes, even if
the family has identified the changes as important. Without malice or intent,
significant others may do things that maintain the client’s dysfunctional and
self-destructive behavior. Clients may get the messages of nonchange either
overtly or covertly. Overtly, clients may be assaulted for going to therapy, as-
Impediments to Change 373
sailed for talking of “private family matters with a stranger,” or teased or stigmatized for being a “psycho” and needing to get their head “shrunk.” Covertly,
the message may be sent by the withdrawal of significant others while clients
are in therapy. In some cases, the clients’ change will make their continuation
within their environment untenable.
Paul was a 25-year-old who had a 6-year heroin habit. He lived at home
with his mother and three brothers. All in his family were heroin addicted. His
mother would boil their “works” (paraphernalia) every night to prevent infection. Paul wanted to join the police department. He had done well in high
school and had avoided the heroin so readily available at home. He knew that
he could not join the police force as a heroin user. He had never been involved
in any drug treatment program nor had he ever been arrested for possession or
use of heroin. He had, on two occasions, stopped using heroin for periods of 3
and 6 months. When asked what got him started again, he replied that it was
impossible to live in his home without someone offering him a “taste.” Although his mother and brothers complimented him on stopping, they also offered him a taste when they scored a particularly good batch of narcotic.
Paul recognized that living at home clean would be too difficult for him
and for his family. To meet his life’s goal of being a police officer, he had to
move away from his home environment.
Therapy Foiled or Sabotaged by Significant Others (SOs)
For many reasons, including expressions of power, the significant others of
clients may sabotage therapy. This can be either directly or indirectly and include not providing transportation for the client or not making agreed-on funds
available for therapy. Other forms of proactive sabotage include the behavior of
the codependent partner who buys alcohol for the alcoholic, buys ice cream by
the gallon for the obese client, or goes shopping for food for the client with
bulimia. This is especially true with children and adolescents. If the parents,
caretakers, and family members are not directly involved, they may actively
sabotage treatment.
Steve, aged 16, was brought to therapy by his mother, Harriet. She announced in the first session that no therapist could deal with Steve. He did not
want to come for therapy and was unwilling to take help that she could offer;
she was generally pessimistic about Steve’s future. Steve had voiced suicidal intent for sometime in the future, had no friends, and was overweight. This was
all said with Steve in the room.
After an initial meeting, Harriet was asked to step into the waiting room
while the therapist spoke with Steve. Harriet was visibly upset. “He’s a minor,
I’m his mother, and I have a duty to be here when you speak to him.” With that
said, Steve began screaming and cursing at her. She seemed embarrassed and
shrugged and left the room, saying, “I think you now see what you’ll be working with.” With his mother out of the room, Steve calmed down. The therapist
set a rule that Harriet was only to come in when invited by the therapist. When
she began to protest, the therapist told her that unless she could agree to the
therapist’s conditions of therapy, he (the therapist) would not start to work
with Steve. Harriet agreed.
374 Basic Techniques for Clinicians—Intervention
Steve was seen for about a dozen sessions. He stated that he liked coming
to see the therapist, was able to calm himself when at home and at school, and
was feeling more hopeful. It was at this point that Harriet called and announced that she had decided that what Steve needed was family therapy and
that she was immediately withdrawing him from work with the therapist. This
was followed by a hushed call by Steve begging the therapist to be allowed to
continue.
Five years later, the therapist received a call from Steve. He had graduated
from a community college, was living across the country from his mother, had
a job, and was feeling “good.” He had called to tell the therapist that the dozen
sessions that he had had given him hope. He had established an identity that
was separate from the dictates of his mother, had a few friends, sought therapy
again, and felt as though he was successful in his life.
Institutional Reinforcement of Illness with Benefits
For many clients, the changes sought in therapy lead to the undesirable consequence of losing funding or benefits based on having psychological problems.
This might include Social Security Disability income, veterans’ benefits, or
workers’ compensation and disability payments. The client is often reinforced
for maintaining symptoms. Successful therapy would very quickly lead to a review by the relevant agency and a loss of benefits. This is not true of every
client who receives such monetary benefits, as some are truly unable to function at a capacity that would resolve this dependence. Others, however, do have
greater potential for change, but the risks of such change appear to outweigh
the benefits.
Allen could be thought of as “retired.” He did not have to work, received
a check each month, had no expenses, could spend the day as he chose, and had
no responsibilities. If he were able to work, have friends, and support himself,
he would lose his retirement and have to follow the same course as most other
adults.
Rose, a 76-year-old woman, lived in a home that she and her late husband
bought 50 years earlier. It was now in need of major plumbing, electrical, and
mechanical repairs. She could not afford them based on her Social Security
check and public assistance. She could use the toilet in one bathroom but not
the sink. She could bathe and use the sink in another bathroom, but not the toilet. Because of the changing neighborhood, she was frightened to shop at the
nearby market. Her windows were nailed shut to prevent break-ins. When
asked why she continued to live there, she pointed out that she could sell the
house, but would then have to turn the money over to the city to reimburse the
city for the public assistance. That would leave her no money, and no home. Her
only recourse would be to live in a shelter.
Cultural Opposition to Help Seeking
The process of therapy, which involves trust, collaboration, self-disclosure,
and change, may be difficult for individuals from cultures where these behaviors are more aberrant than common. An understanding of the cultural
rules and schemas of a culture will help the therapist avoid these reasons for
impasse.
Impediments to Change 375
Questions about cultural rules of an individual or of a family can often be
addressed through supervision or consultation. Cultural issues that could impact the therapy might be related to the therapist’s gender, age, or ethnicity.
Certain religious groups demand that the client find a therapist of their
religious group inasmuch as therapists of other religious groups might not understand the client’s behaviors. In many cases, the cultural issue may be reflective of the client feeling uncomfortable with a therapist of a different cultural
group just as a therapist may be equally uncomfortable with a client of a different group.
Jena, aged 36, had converted from Christianity to Judaism to marry
Michael. Her husband then joined a Chasidic group and Jena found herself in
the midst of an ultra-Orthodox sect. In keeping with the cultural expectations,
Jena had 5 children in 7 years. After her third child was born, Jena started to
have severe headaches that, at first, were responsive to medication. Now, nothing seemed to help. They went to the rabbi, who after listening to her complaints, asked that all the mezuzahs (prayers on the doorpost of their home) be
brought to him. He read each one and found that the scribe who had written
them had made several errors. He predicted that once the errors were corrected, Jena’s headaches would vanish. After the corrections were made, Jena
had a brief period of relief, followed by a return of the headaches.
When she sought therapy from a Jewish therapist, the parameters of therapy were spelled out in a call from the rabbi for their group. He told the therapist what could and could not be discussed in therapy. Religion was not to be
discussed, her role within the community could not be discussed, her relationship with her husband should not be questioned, and the requirements of being
a Jewish wife could not be discussed. Rather than following his initial reaction
to refuse the case, the therapist asked for and received the client’s permission to
include the rabbi as a consultant to the therapy. The rabbi agreed to be available. Using the rabbi as a consultant, the therapist was, in fact, able to deal with
a number of relationship issues. Key among them was her husband’s demand
for more children. With the rabbi’s consultation, this demand was removed
inasmuch as having more children would cause damage to Jena, making her
less able to be the mother and Jewish wife that she was expected to be.
Maintenance of System Homeostasis
A systems model of family and group dynamics suggests that systems will work
(sometimes very hard) to maintain a balance or homeostasis. In its simplest
form, it involves keeping things as close to where they are as possible. Change
is seen as undesirable, and even dangerous, because the loss of homeostasis
brings about anxiety and the resultant discomfort. Through direct and indirect
maneuvering, families and other systems will seek to keep all members in the
same approximate position, even if that position is one of discomfort, pain, or
pathology. If, for example, the issue for a patient is being in a position of power,
any event or interaction that places the person in a position that seems less
than powerful will result in immediate action to restore the perception of
power.
What occurs in many interactions (especially true in family and couples
work) is that the participants know when the actions will reach the homeostatic
376 Basic Techniques for Clinicians—Intervention
point. If any member crosses that line, the system will be unbalanced. To avoid
that, the members will withdraw from the interaction thereby using a homeostatic cutoff to keep things balanced.
Hillary, aged 40, was a single woman who lived with her physically disabled father. He was wheelchair-bound and spent the day in his room watching
television. Hillary would prepare his breakfast, prepare his lunch, and always
be home to prepare dinner. She would wash his clothes and clean the house. He
would greet her each night telling her about how tasteless the lunch had been.
He would often throw the food and dishes against the walls and then demand
that she clean up. He insulted her and called her “lazy and stupid” or called her
a “cow.” Her response to his insults was to apologize and tell him that she
would be more careful in the future. If he did not like what she prepared for
dinner, he would throw the plate against the wall and demand something else.
She had learned many years earlier that there was no time for dating in
her life because it interfered with her care of her father. When questioned
about her caring for her father, her response was that she had to do it because
if she didn’t no one else would. She sought therapy close to her 40th birthday.
She had decided that unless she did something else, she was going to die alone.
One of the therapeutic interventions was an attempt to extinguish her father’s abusive behavior. What Hillary agreed to try was to continue to make
him breakfast and lunch, but she would tell him that if he threw his dinner
against the wall she would not replace it and there would be no food again until
breakfast. That night he threw his dinner against the wall and screamed insults
at her. When she cleaned up the food and told him that there would be no food
until breakfast, he continued to scream insults at her. This continued for 2
more days. On the third day, he ate dinner without comment. He even asked for
seconds. Hillary needed support for what she knew she needed to be doing.
Over the course of the next few months, the same contingencies were used to
have him stop insulting her.
Gross Family Pathology
Related to the issue of homeostasis is frank family pathology. In this situation,
the level of emotional, cognitive, psychic, or behavioral functioning is diagnosed as disturbed. The pathology may take the form of global drug use, sexual
acting out, antisocial behavior, boundary violations, or abusive behavior (sexual, emotional, and physical) overt control and manipulation or all of the preceding. Individuals coming from chaotic, dysfunctional, and pathological
families can be said to come by their problems honestly.
It is no surprise when the therapist discovers during the client’s evaluation
that there is a significant family history of a particular symptom or disorder.
Disorders that are known to be heritable (e.g., bipolar illness, depression, or
schizophrenia) are often diagnosed by the presence of the family history. In
other cases, the family pathology results in a physically, mentally, or psychologically abusive environment that the therapist must report to social welfare or
legal offices.
Beyond the difficulties caused by the client’s own measure of this disturbance, the family circumstances are an impediment to progress when the chaos
or pathology of the family makes it difficult or impossible for the client to
Impediments to Change 377
change. The family pathology contributes to the smaller scale impediments to
change through missed appointments, problems in doing homework, difficulty
in maintaining gains, or the maintenance of a negative set concerning therapy.
Family problems may absorb an inordinate amount of therapeutic time, as the
client is constantly dealing with crises and demands from others in the system.
The only way that some clients can escape the influence of their family is
to physically leave the home or geographic area. For children, this is impossible, though the government may determine that it is in the best interests of a
child or adolescent to be placed in a foster care or institutional setting.
Alex was referred by his high school guidance counselor because of academic difficulty and failure, truancy, and fighting in school. When the psychologist called Alex’s mother and asked to meet with her, she claimed to be
unavailable. When the psychologist insisted, she became angry and started
cursing. When she was told that by not assuring that Alex went to school she
was in legal jeopardy, she agreed to come in. She came for the session and was
clearly intoxicated, whether on alcohol or some other substance. She informed
the psychologist that Alex’s father was incarcerated for assault with a deadly
weapon, and several other offenses. He was eligible for parole some 10 years
hence. It became clear that Alex came by his style honestly and was following
in his parent’s path.
Unrealistic Demands Compounded by Family Members
Clients can be confused or even paralyzed by their internal demands. These demands are complicated by hopelessness and inability to challenge this demanding internal dialogue. Such ruminations can cause clients to end up in a
downward spiral. When the external voices of family, friends, and significant
others are added to the mix, the client may be frozen in place or may even take
a contrary position and do whatever is opposed to the demands of others. The
therapist may be placed in the same role as these demanding others.
Claudia, aged 36, was the middle of five children, having an older brother
and sister and a younger brother and sister. Her siblings had all graduated from
prestigious universities and now held high-paying professional positions. All
were married and all had families. Claudia saw herself as the “failure,” “disappointment,” “black sheep,” and “disturbed one” of all of her siblings. She graduated from a community college and worked as a manager at a convenience
store. Her internal dialogue regarding her failure was amplified whenever her
parents would beg her to return to school and get a “real degree.” “Then,” they
said, “she could get a real job.” Being compared with her sisters who, her parents said, “are no smarter than you” was a constant source of distress.
Claudia viewed therapy as one more opportunity to fail. In fact, if she succeeded at therapy, it might mean that there would be both internal and external pressure to do even more.
Unrealistic Demands by Institutions
The major demands on clients from institutions and agencies come as a twoedged sword. One message is that change is desired, but the other message is
that change must occur within a limited time frame due to reimbursement
policies. Insurers and therapists voice the goal that there should be services
378 Basic Techniques for Clinicians—Intervention
provided for those in need. At the same time, Clients know that if they do not
or cannot change within the limits of reimbursed services, they will be limited
in the therapy that they will receive.
Henry had an insurance plan that provided for 10 therapy sessions per
year. His long-term emotional difficulties needed a far more intensive approach. He reported that he barely got started in therapy when termination occurred. It was hard for Henry to use those 10 sessions very productively due to
his anxiety about losing access to treatment.
Financial Factors May Limit the Opportunities for Change
Financial factors can impede therapy in several ways. Related to the previously
noted point, once reimbursed services run out, therapy will end unless the patient has the financial resources to continue (or if the therapist can see the patient for a substantially reduced fee or for free). The financial issue can also be
a factor in abusive relationships; abused partners may be afraid of leaving because of inadequate financial resources to support themselves and their families. They may then choose to stay in an abusive situation against the best
interests of their personal safety or the safety of their family.
Marika was involved in a relationship with a man who would drink and
then become verbally and physically abusive. He was one of a series of abusive
relationship that Marika had over the years. To financially support her three
children, she stayed with her partner. Unlike previous partners, he provided a
home, food, utilities, and some companionship when not drinking. She resolved that it was better to be beaten than to lose whatever security she and her
children now had.
Lack of Resources or Support from the Environment
Clients may come to see the therapist as their principal support person. They
may experience few people in the world as accepting, understanding, caring,
and thoughtful as the therapist. They then place all of their eggs in the therapist’s basket. Therapy, however, is in many ways an unreal relationship, and it
has never been intended to replace a nonprofessional social network. One of
the goals of therapy with all patients is to help them build a broader, more useful, more accepting, more available, more generous, and more appropriate support network. Sometimes this can be done through recognized support groups
such as Alcoholics Anonymous, parenting groups, or disability-oriented groups,
or interest-based clubs such as a coin-collecting club or a bicycle riding club.
Rose, the elderly woman living alone in the crumbling home described
earlier, had one person she saw regularly, her therapist. Each week, she drove
the few miles to her provider’s office for their weekly chat. These meetings provided Rose with a purpose in getting out of her house and the sense of a safe
connection with someone in the outside world. There was little change in
Rose’s overall situation from week to week. Remaining stable and independent
was her primary therapeutic goal.
Resources with Conflicting Agendas for the Client
Many institutions give clients mixed messages. They state that they are willing
to support the individual because of the individual’s disability. This support
Impediments to Change 379
might include medical coverage, living expenses, and housing expenses. Support, however, is predicated on the individual having a diagnosable medical or
psychiatric disorder. The therapy provided under the institutional plans,
whether through the federal government or through some agency, requires
that the individual work to overcome the pathology. At that point, all financial
support would cease. It would be reasonable for an individual who is reinforced for having severe psychopathology to want to maintain their support.
Leonard, aged 56, was a client in a community mental health setting. He
had been receiving Social Security Supplemental Income (SSI) for at least 30
years. Though a college graduate, Leonard had a breakdown at age 24 and had
to leave his job and continue to live with his parents. He was diagnosed as having a schizoaffective disorder. He claims that he never had delusions or hallucinations, nor does he have them at this point. He was, and still is, he says,
extremely depressed. The diagnosis was adequate to get the government funding. The diagnosis has been used ever since despite the lack of his meeting criteria. When asked about this, Leonard smiles and replies, “When they ask me
about having hallucinations and delusions, I just smile and shake my head.
They always think that I am lying and that I am just not admitting to having
them. I have never lied.”
At this point in life, Leonard sees himself as retired. He sees no reason to
be in therapy. He takes antidepressant medication for the depression.
Problem or Pathology Factors
Cognitive Rigidity
The personality rigidity of some clients foils their ability to productively benefit
from therapy. With clients who are obsessive-compulsive, or paranoid, among
others, their symptoms preclude their acceptance of the therapist’s influence.
They may question the therapist’s motives or goals. They may be unable to
break out of the rigid position that they see themselves as having to maintain to
stay safe.
Significant Medical or Physiological Problems
It is essential for every client coming for therapy to have a complete medical
evaluation as part of a comprehensive assessment and treatment plan. It is unethical and dangerous for the therapist to be treating what may appear to be
psychological disorders that have a medical etiology. A client with hypothyroidism may appear depressed because of the slowed action and thinking. Conversely, hyperthyroidism might be confused with anxiety disorders.
Trust Impairments
Trust is a central issue in therapy. The trust must be bidirectional where the
client trusts the therapist and the therapist can trust the client. Clients with
problems of trust as a diagnostic part of the disorder will have problems in therapy. Traumatized clients may have recurring trust challenges, both internal and
external to therapy. Dangerous, threatening or antisocial clients can create unsafe conditions that make it impossible to continue therapy. Trust is a primary
goal, and until it begins to develop, little other progress is likely.
380 Basic Techniques for Clinicians—Intervention
Autonomy Press
Autonomous individuals will be reluctant to come for therapy. Their view is
that if they cannot help themselves, no one else can help them. The idea of
coming to someone’s office at a time set by someone else’s schedule, to talk
about personal matters, at best, is uncomfortable. Opening up to the possibility
of feedback and influence from others is even more difficult. Their avoidance of
therapy is seen as one way of maintaining their autonomy.
Impulsivity and Poor Executive Control
Clients who are impulsive, and this includes most children and adolescents, see
therapy as restrictive and limiting. At best, it is out of line with how they generally respond, at worst the therapy is seen as an onerous and problematic requirement that they cannot meet. Their standard and accustomed manner of
response is to act without thinking or self-monitoring rather than to selfmonitor and to think about actions.
Cognitive Limitations, Impairment, or Confusion
Clients who are confused because of schizophrenia, bipolar illness, or neurological injury or deficit will have difficulty making use of therapy. They may
have memory problems, difficulty in follow-through, difficulty with homework, and problems dealing with any abstractions. For some, verbal psychotherapy may be contraindicated, at least until their mental status improves
sufficiently enough to engage in some verbal exchange.
Clients may have limited cognitive ability as a result of limited intellectual
ability or neurological deficit. Their processing will be limited by the lowered
level of cognitive integration. Therapy goals will need to be adjusted according
to their capacity for learning and abstraction.
Social Isolation or Alienation
Relative social isolation can impede therapy by virtue of the reduced opportunities for the client. Autonomous clients may have difficulties with this, as they
are apt to tolerate and even seek jobs and situations where they can go about
their business relatively unfettered by the needs and demands of others. But
that also means that they will lack access to the support and stimulation of others. Other clients may be isolated due to some aspect of their family pathology
(known drug abusers), their personality style (e.g., introverted), or a low social
currency (e.g., physically unattractive).
Symptom Profusion
Anxious clients can overwhelm the therapist with graphic, elaborate, and detailed descriptions of their symptoms. Their idea is that if anything is left out,
they run the risk that the omitted piece will be the essential piece that makes it
impossible for them to be helped. If part of their symptom picture is gastrointestinal distress, they will regale the therapist with images of their distress. The
therapist will quickly learn more about the client’s gastrointestinal tract than is
necessary. These clients actually take a fairly dependent approach to therapy by
trying to spill all the details, expecting that the therapist will then organize all
Impediments to Change 381
the information and provide curative answers. In essence, clients avoid selfreflection by filling therapy time with excessively detailed symptomatic reports.
Extreme Dependence
Clients who are dependent often work to ensure that the therapist is totally and
completely on their side. They may overwhelm the therapist with data, bring
the therapist gifts, or praise the therapist for wit, insight, sensitivity, and perspicacity. The goal is closeness. Without the closeness, they believe that they will
be injured or even destroyed. They are often frightened by goal-oriented therapy in that it means that in a relatively short time they will be without their
helper.
Ongoing Self-Devaluation
Often termed low self-esteem or poor self-image, this involves devaluing
everything that one does or the concomitant overvaluing what everyone else
does (and therefore by comparison devaluing self). This often leads to “yesbut” behavior and to devaluing both the therapy and the therapist. This devaluation can be summed up by paraphrasing Groucho Marx’s comment, “I would
never join any club that would have me as a member.” The therapist and the
therapy are, by extension of working with the client, tainted.
Limited Energy for Change
Depression is a major contributor to this impediment. Individuals who are depressed will often have vegetative signs that include lowered energy. It then becomes difficult to cooperate in therapy because the major goal is to avoid any
activity that requires action or energy. The level of energy within the session,
for homework, or for interpersonal relationships is minimal. However, change
requires some energy. Thus, the pace of these clients’ change will be determined by the amount of energy that can be activated for working on change.
Substance Misuse
If substance-abusing clients come to sessions drunk or stoned, they cannot
make use of the therapy. What may occur is state-dependent learning whereby
they can only act in certain ways when under the influence of the substance.
Clients who are semiaware or semirelated to the therapist will make little use of
the therapy. When sober, they either will not remember what was said or done
or will have distorted it due to the filter of the drugs.
Summary
Despite carefully gathering data, organizing the obtained information, using a
structured and coherent approach to planning treatment and following a welldefined model of therapy, there are still potential impediments to effective, successful short-term therapy. Often, when treatment appears to stumble or falter,
the responsibility for the difficulties is laid at the doorstep of the client. Traditionally, difficulties in treatment were viewed as the result of client resistance,
382 Basic Techniques for Clinicians—Intervention
either to the treatment or to change itself. Though convenient, such a view is
unfair, and often inaccurate.
The variables that can, and often do act to impede the progress of therapy
can be roughly divided into four categories; client factors, therapist factors, environmental factors, and problem or pathology factors.
Often, interactions of the variables in each of these categories can and will
limit the speed and the efficacy of treatment. These difficulties may lie in a lack
or absence of essential skills on the part of the client or the therapist, the lack of
motivation for change on the part of the client, the lack of structure in the
planning or goal setting of therapy, or unclear expectations on the part of both
the client and therapist. The symptoms or pathology that prompted treatment
in the first place present challenges to be specifically addressed as impediments
or barriers to treatment. These pathology factors should not just be attributed to
a client’s preference for pathology.
Bordin’s model of the working alliance emphasizes that the agreement as
to the goals and tasks of therapy, as well as the establishment of a positive, interpersonal bond between client and therapist are crucial to the success of
therapy. Many of the identified impediments to therapy appear to be related to
difficulties in the establishment of the working alliance. Lack of clarity in the
definition of problems and their related goals, lack of precision in the definition of the tasks of treatment, as well as confusion about the division of labor
in treatment and the failure to establish a collaborative, goal-directed relationship can severely limit the effectiveness of treatment. Other impediments are
related to the therapeutic bond. Lack of trust, interpersonal distance, therapeutic narcissism, overly technical or cold therapists, or extreme client dependence are disruptive forces that impede the emotional bond that is a
foundation of therapy.
Some impediments to treatment may not reside within the persons of the
therapist or client. Cultural, familial, social, and interpersonal factors can all
contribute to difficulties encountered in the treatment setting. In addition, factors related to the health and medical well-being of the client may contribute to
the degree of difficulty in a structured, planned intervention.

Effective Termination
Termination refers to a point of ending in therapy. For one reason or another, contact between client and therapist is discontinued. Effectively
managed termination is a beneficial step in creating a lasting impression of
therapy as a positive experience. Likewise, if the process is poorly handled or
insufficiently negotiated, closure can diminish benefits. In more extreme
terms, a good termination can seal the success of therapy forever, but a bad termination can sour the best efforts.
Learning Objectives
At the end of this chapter, the reader should be able to:
• Understand the rationale, foundation, and main components of an effective termination strategy.
• List six different types of termination.
• Explain the professional standards of care for competent termination.
• Define client abandonment.
• List 10 applied skills for effective termination.
There are two major viewpoints on psychotherapy termination. One view
is that termination is a logical conclusion that can be identified easily and intuitively when the pace of therapy slows or goals are reached. The other holds
that termination is a crucial stage in the therapy process that merits explicit and
careful attention. Both perspectives are relevant, but neither alone fully prepares therapists for the termination challenges of contemporary practice.
384 Basic Techniques for Clinicians—Intervention
Rationale for a Termination Strategy
Beliefs about when and why therapy should end are typically influenced by an
overall theoretical perspective on clinical psychopathology and the means and
ends of intervention. To some, therapy should conclude only after the patient’s
internal resources have been substantially strengthened by experiences accumulated during a long-term relationship with a therapist. To others, therapy
should conclude as soon as the patient experiences significant relief from targeted symptoms or problems. Both perspectives have empirical support, but we
are only just beginning to develop evidence-based ways to determine the
needed length of therapy. Practical contingencies often trump theoretical aspirations when it comes down to everyday decisions. At the same time, all therapist actions must fall within the bounds of ethical professional conduct. No
practical situation trumps this responsibility, but many circumstances require
difficult judgments.
Effectively navigating termination requires the clinician to blend clinical,
practical and ethical or professional considerations into a sound strategy. Here
are some hypothetical scenarios to illustrate why such a strategy is needed, and
what can happen when this vital ingredient is missing.
Practice Scenario 1: Trainee Limits
Anna was finishing a graduate practicum at the university student counseling
center. She felt highly attached to her clients and conflicted about terminating
therapy at the close of the semester. It made her sad to think that these relationships would “just end” and she would not know what happened in the lives of
her clients. As the time for termination drew closer, Anna avoided the topic.
She hoped to continue with some of her clients, although pragmatically this
was difficult and discouraged by the counseling center administration. New
class and research responsibilities would have to be compromised to make
time. The counseling center had defined office hours and very tightly allocated
office space, making schedules almost impossible, unless she broke the rules
and saw the clients after hours or at another location, without actual supervision. Anna began to ruminate about giving her favorite clients her home telephone number, and offering to correspond via e-mail or meet regularly for
coffee. That way, they could stay in touch.
Practice Scenario 2: Personal Changes and
Unprofessional Actions
Helen had been in intermittent treatment for depression for a dozen years at
the same clinic, with several therapist transfers. Each of these former transfers
had a reason that made sense to Helen. The most recent, however, occurred
without Helen’s realization. She had attempted to return after a hiatus of 6
months and found that her therapist was no longer working at that clinic. Further, she was informed that she could no longer be seen as a client in this practice due to changes in business policies, and no contact information was
available for her former therapist.


At her support group meeting, Helen softly sobbed, “What is wrong with
me that even my therapist didn’t want to see me anymore?” Someone in the
group told her that this therapist had relocated to a new office in a nearby
county, and had transferred many patients with him. Helen then tried to contact the therapist at his new location, and was informed by staff that his practice
was full and he was no longer accepting any new or transfer clients. The therapist did not return her call or make any attempt to contact her or assist with
transfer of her care or records.
Practice Scenario 3: Managed Care
After a few years in independent practice, Kelly began to worry that he was
burning out as a psychotherapist. He was vaguely depressed and demoralized,
although he continued to believe that he was doing good, ethical work and
helping his clients. He had been trained in both brief and long-term interventions. In ongoing practice, he found that it was difficult to terminate clients
after only brief interventions, and challenging to keep long-term treatments
oriented toward a goal. Many of his most difficult clients had treatment subsidized by managed care programs that approved only brief segments of therapy,
from 8 to 12 sessions per authorization. Monitoring and repeatedly obtaining
managed care approval was a recurring stress for him and his clients as it
seemed they had to talk about possible termination every time they turned
around.
Practice Scenario 4: Poor Boundaries
At her first session, Julie bluntly told her therapist, “I want to be sure that I
don’t get tangled up in therapy that goes on forever.” When the therapist inquired about Julie’s previous experience in therapy, she described a relatively
helpful, positive interaction. However, she felt somewhat guilty about having
“ducked-out” by simply failing to show for scheduled appointments and not returning the therapist’s calls and attempts to reschedule. “He was really nice and
supportive, but I was frustrated and did not know how to handle the situation.
We spent a lot of time talking about his life, and it got to the point where I
wasn’t sure which one of us was the therapist and which was the client. I didn’t
want to hurt his feelings, but I felt trapped, so I just stopped. This time, I want
to be sure the focus is on me.”
Practice Scenario 5: Unfocused Therapy
Andrew was somewhat confused about when it was appropriate for him to initiate termination. As a postdoctoral clinician, he had a foundation of basic experience, but he still had numerous questions about how and when to draw
therapy to an appropriate close. Many of his clients had resolved their initial
target problem but still had daily hassles and issues to discuss. Andrew continued to see them in therapy, but the work was unfocused. There were no established goals that could be measured, or objectives that would indicate the
completion of their work together. Much of the time he and the client seemed
386 Basic Techniques for Clinicians—Intervention
to be just chitchatting. Andrew felt uncomfortable about bringing up the subject of termination because he was afraid it would cause uproar with some
clients, or that the client or his peers might construe this as client abandonment. So he kept scheduling sessions, avoided the subject, and decided that the
client would ultimately decide when enough was enough.
Practice Scenario 6: Harassment of Therapist
Joan had been working for more than a year with Leigh, an emotionally labile,
depressed young woman with aggressive and self-destructive tendencies. Leigh
demanded that Joan write a letter of “fitness for duty” so that she could return
to work after a mental health leave of absence. Leigh indicated that the letter
should attest to her emotional stability, ability to work effectively with people
who might be sick or otherwise vulnerable, and her ability to be honest and
trustworthy handling the personal belongings of others.
Joan did not think that she could reasonably make these statements based
on Leigh’s history and current functioning, so she declined to write the letter.
Leigh was outraged by this refusal and exploded with demands and threats,
saying she would stalk Joan until she wrote the letter, or enlist the help of her
gang-involved boyfriend if necessary. Joan was frightened and wondered
whether she should just write a generically supportive letter, or continue to refuse and maybe obtain a gun for self-protection. Instead, she decided to schedule more frequent sessions with Leigh to discuss the letter, but keep pepper
spray and a cell phone nearby at all times.
It may be helpful to pause at this point for discussion or reflection on how
you would describe the problems being encountered in the vignettes described
above. What are the different risks? Are there any potential ethical violations,
and if so, what are they? What do you think the therapist could or should do to
manage each situation?
These cases illustrate how therapy does not always conclude smoothly or
easily. And these are but a few of the risky and rocky situations that can develop when the therapist lacks a steady hand in directing therapy toward an appropriate conclusion under varying conditions. The client may appear to make
little if any progress. It may seem that the client will need therapy indefinitely.
Or it may be that circumstances abruptly precipitate termination. The client
and therapist might be uncertain of how much therapy is “enough.” Strong
emotions may make the ending particularly difficult. Conflicts and high emotions can significantly impact the judgment of either client or therapist, further
complicating an already challenging task. Failure to address termination directly can leave both client and therapist struggling with confusion and increase the vulnerability to adverse outcomes. Therapy can become unfocused,
unproductive, or even harmful if termination is not incorporated into the goals
of treatment.
Without a strategy to effectively manage termination, the therapist is ill
equipped to productively channel emotions or maintain a strong and reasoned
professional course of action. Termination is to a clinician what the landing of
an aircraft is to a pilot—a task that requires focused attention, skill, and planning, with an increased risk of adverse events or possible negative professional
Effective Termination 387
and legal consequences. Just as the pilot needs a flight plan, the clinician needs
a treatment plan. Just as the pilot needs to land the plane at the appropriate
time and location before running out of fuel, the clinician also needs to conclude therapy before running on fumes. Just as the pilot sometimes needs to
deal with storms, winds, and inclement conditions, the clinician needs to deal
with high emotions and other nonambient forces. Both want to achieve a safe
and uneventful landing.
Effective Termination Strategy
Effective termination strategy is based on a foundation of clinical, ethical, and
practical judgments. It is a “best practice” approach of creating positive closure
in the greatest number of cases. This maximizes the usefulness of therapy
overall, and minimizes possible stresses, especially the stress of a poor outcome
for the client and an adverse professional or legal action for the provider. The
judgments of a termination strategy are not separate or distinct, but blended
together in a plan for termination that is under development and revision
throughout therapy.
Main Components
The termination strategy has two main components: (1) ongoing communication and negotiation of the ending that is directly linked to the overall treatment plan, and (2) a reasonable plan of action that estimates when, why, and
how termination will take place. Ideally, effective termination begins before intake, as the provider determines on the basis of his or her skills and competence
those who will or will not be accepted for treatment. From there, termination
issues are addressed in the first few meetings in the context of informed consent to service and orientation to the tasks of treatment (J. Beck, 1995; B. E.
Bernstein & Hartsell, 2000; S. A. Kramer, 1986).
Any course of therapy, no matter how brief or lengthy, needs to have
a beginning, middle, and end, and a plan for what will take place during
each segment. As part of this fundamental structure, termination is acknowledged right from the beginning and a plan for termination is under consideration at all times. Creating a plan for termination can be considered a task of
treatment that is best approached through collaborative discussion. This
opens up a dialogue and establishes termination as part of the therapeutic
work and not simply an eventual destination or a unilateral decision of either
participant.
Types of Termination
According to Davis (2008), the quality of a termination can be characterized
by the quality of interaction between the participants concerning the ending
of their contract. The quality of interaction is determined by three elements:
(1) direct communication about reasons for termination; (2) opportunity to
388 Basic Techniques for Clinicians—Intervention
express feelings, check perceptions, and assess satisfaction with the therapy
and therapist; and (3) a clear disposition decision concerning any ongoing or
potential future needs.
A better quality termination includes some direct communication about
the decision to terminate, some assessment and expression of affect, including
elements of satisfaction, dissatisfaction, or uncertainty, and a mutual understanding of a specified disposition, whether that disposition is final closure,
transfer, open-ended follow-up, or some other specified plan. In poor terminations, there is little or no direct communication about the reasons and timing of
termination, there may be no expressed affect or conversely an unproductive
profusion of affect, and finally there may be confusion or misunderstanding
about the disposition. The taxonomy of five types of termination is described by
Davis (2008): prospective, flexible, complex, oblique, and unprofessional termination. A sixth category—premature termination—is included here because
it is commonly discussed in the literature. These types of termination describe
a spectrum of possible experiences, from the positive closure we ideally hope to
capture to the conflicted or unprofessional termination that we aspire to minimize or avoid.
Premature Termination
Premature termination has been referred to as the ending of treatment without
the sense of psychological closure that comes with having resolved problems or
at least with an understanding of the reasons for ending therapy (Kleinke,
1994). In a research context, premature termination has been variously defined as failure to complete a predetermined number of sessions (Pekarik,
1992) or as attending only one to four sessions (Garfield, 1994). A problem
with the term premature is that these many different definitions have created a
category with multiple possible meanings. Prematurity is either judged from
the clinician’s perspective or is based simply on the client having chosen to attend only a few sessions.
Premature termination is considered a problematic waste of resources
and potentially demoralizing to both clinician and provider (Reis & Brown,
2006). However, clients who drop out before an expected number of sessions
are a heterogeneous group. The judgment of a termination as premature may
be due to a mismatch of expectations between therapist and client, where the
therapist is skeptical of quick fixes but the client prefers and expects brief
therapy (Reis & Brown, 2006). To avoid the implications of a therapist bias toward long-term treatment, we prefer not to label any termination as premature. Instead, a more specific term can be selected from the other types of
termination, based on the quality of the interaction rather than the assumptions of the therapist. A more qualitative description of termination allows us
to better understand the interaction between provider and client and to recognize the client’s stage of change as relevant to the length of therapy (see
Chapter 12 on understanding change).
Prospective Termination
Prospective termination is the expected model for termination. Most often, the
client’s goals have been reached and provider and client agree that it is reason-
Effective Termination 389
able to draw therapy to a close. Sometimes prospective termination occurs
without the client’s goals being fully achieved, but termination is planned for
some other reason such as a specific time limit. Prospective termination always
includes some advance notice, even if that is only a few sessions or possibly just
one. There is a shared decision-making process where various considerations
are directly discussed by the provider and the client. Often there is some progression into the process of termination, such as spacing out sessions at greater
time intervals until a final session is planned.
The decision to end therapy ideally includes agreement between
provider and client, but total agreement is not necessary. Either party has
veto power over the therapy relationship. The client has absolute veto power
and can end therapy at any time for any reason. The clinician must operate
within the bounds of professional duty and cannot end therapy without cause
but can and sometimes must end therapy with cause, ethically and positively.
The provider’s actions are still positive and constructive because there is an
identified reason, a clear disposition, and a process of direct communication
with the client.
In prospective terminations, it sometimes happens that neither provider
nor client is actually happy about ending, but they have identified, discussed,
and understand the reasons for the action. There has been an opportunity for
the client to express feelings and ask questions to resolve doubts or check perceptions. The therapist has made an effort to assess the client’s satisfaction with
both therapy and the therapist. Overall, the process of interaction and psychological integration is positive, even if there is a range of conflicted emotions.
There is no specific expectation of permanent resolution of problems as a prerequisite for termination. Circumstances may bring about unexpected or forced
termination, and the provider must handle it in an appropriate and skillful professional manner. A caring, dignified, and respectful approach to creating a
transition out of therapy can engender positive closure even under less than
ideal circumstances.
In terms of disposition, both client and provider know that therapy has
ended. They are clear on how any ongoing or future client needs might be
handled. Disposition often includes an option to follow up “as needed.” Clients
vary in their potential need for follow-up, depending on the nature and severity of their original problems and their access to treatment. In some situations,
follow-up may not be likely or feasible because of personal changes, as people
move and redirect their lives. When the provider is certain that he or she will
not be available for follow-up beyond a certain point (e.g., moving in 6
months), then some discussion of follow-up alternatives is needed. If termination is forced by the limits of insurance, managed care, or other financial factors and the client is otherwise unready for termination, referrals and efforts to
link the client to other resources are vital to a positive process. These are often
the most difficult dispositions and are where the clinician is most apt to extend
efforts to allow time for formal departure discussion and planning.
Flexible Termination
Flexible termination occurs when the client has improved but postpones
further sessions or does not follow up in rescheduling. Regular meetings are
390 Basic Techniques for Clinicians—Intervention
discontinued, but the formal process of closure is abbreviated and the option
to return is open and left to the client’s discretion. Usually the client has made
some gains and the termination is generally positive and appropriate. The opportunity for follow-up is made clearly available, and it is assumed that the
client will take advantage of this option if and when it may be needed.
Flexible termination may be appropriate and useful when the client has
insufficient energy for active change but also does not want to definitively
withdraw from the process either. There has been some improvement and the
client is either saying, “That’s enough for now. I’ll be back later for more,” or
“This might be enough but I’m not sure.” Circumstances often combine with
initial improvements, tipping the client toward greater willingness to stop and
resume when issues might be more pressing or change is more readily possible.
The emotional tone of a flexible termination is usually positive, and the established relationship remains as a viable resource for the client, although the ongoing contract for sessions is discontinued.
Based on previous experience with Lucy (case example), the therapist interpreted the message to mean that Lucy was in less distress and wanted to terminate contact for some undetermined and perhaps indefinite length of time,
Case Example—Prospective Termination
Luke had worked with his therapist off
and on for over 3 years when his employer abruptly changed insurance
plans. His therapist was not in the preferred provider network of his new
plan. Luke was going through some significant family stress, and he had been
dissatisfied with several previous therapists so he was not enthusiastic about a
transfer. The provider checked with the
insurance plan and they approved payment for three sessions to allow time
for closure and transition to a new therapist, if the client wished to continue
therapy. There was no provision for
payment beyond that point because
there were plenty of other in-network
providers in the geographic area.
Luke presented no imminent danger
of harm to himself or anyone else. The
three sessions were used to discuss
Luke’s current status and situation, his
overall progress and the skills he had
acquired, the financial implications of
continuing with his current provider
versus transferring to a new therapist,
his options of continuing treatment
or terminating with an option to begin
with a new therapist, and his feelings
about the current situation and the
therapy process. Luke had an opportunity to ask questions, express his
feelings, assess his strengths and accomplishments, get the therapist’s help
in weighing the options and making a
decision, and be reassured of the therapist’s support in providing records or
information to new providers should
Luke request that in the future. Luke
expressed satisfaction with his progress
and with the provider’s efforts to offer
formal termination discussion. Together they reviewed the list of alternative providers, and the therapist helped
Luke identify three likely candidates.
Luke decided that he would use this list
for his plan to follow up on an “as
needed” basis.
Effective Termination 391
knowing she had the option of returning. In supporting Lucy’s autonomy and
self-directed use of resources, the therapist accepted this as a flexible termination
and did not insist that Lucy complete a formal termination. The therapist left a
follow-up message for Lucy stating, “I got your message. That’s fine. I assume
that you will let me know if or when you want to reschedule or resume sessions.
If you want to come in to talk about this plan, don’t hesitate to call me.”
Complex Termination
Complex termination happens when communications about termination do not
follow an ordinary course. Most clients can discuss termination and come to a
reasonable resolution. However, some clients have extreme emotional reactions, or they may not be able to discuss termination in a reasonable way at all.
Complex terminations are difficult and stressful for client and provider, and
resolution is not readily established. These terminations require additional attention and care, as the risk for an adverse outcome is elevated.
Complex terminations can be triggered by several factors that interact and
produce a bottleneck in communication. These factors include the client’s interpersonal response biases, the provider’s vulnerabilities, length of therapy,
the client’s progress, and the precipitating reasons for termination. The client’s
idiosyncratic cognitive profile and coping strategies are often the most significant factors in this equation, along with situations that produce significant secondary gain or advantages associated with the client’s illness.
Clients with personality disorders or significant Axis II psychopathology
are most likely to have a complex termination. These clients have a tendency to
prolong or otherwise distort termination, and the clinician must create and
maintain reasonable boundaries. Clients who are emotionally overwrought by
termination need special assistance in coming to terms with these limits and in
managing their emotional reactions. Gradually fading sessions or building toward termination help to mediate a highly reactive client’s perceptions of termination as being too abrupt. Clients also sometimes terminate in abrupt,
precipitous ways. Clinicians usually attempt to prevent abrupt departures by
involving the client in a plan for termination early in therapy, and encouraging
the client to discuss any impulses toward suddenly quitting therapy.
Case Example—Flexible Termination
Lucy was in therapy off and on for various health anxiety issues. Over time,
she had made notable gains. Recently,
she returned for help with a bout of obsessive thinking triggered by some unusual sensations in her chest. Over the
course of six sessions, Lucy quickly activated her skills in managing thoughts
about potential health problems, and
she identified other contributing tensions, including work stress and family
conflict. Although the various stresses
continued, Lucy was coping better and
worrying less. When a schedule conflict
caused her to cancel an appointment,
she left a message stating, “I’d like to
cancel for now and get back with you
after things settle down.”
392 Basic Techniques for Clinicians—Intervention
Consultation helps support the provider through what may be a difficult,
even arduous process of making judgments and taking actions under stressful
conditions, especially when there is overt conflict or the client becomes angry
or accuses the therapist of wrongdoing. This high-risk situation recalls our
metaphor of attempting to land an aircraft, but the original flight plan has been
rendered impossible by thunderstorms or gale force winds. Redirection is necessary to protect the safety of all involved.
Case Example—Complex Termination
Gail was extremely emotionally reactive
and prone to misinterpret the actions of
her therapist. She often worried that she
was “a pain” to the therapist and expected to be dumped or fired as a client.
This was a significant pattern in Gail’s
life, as she was highly sensitive to potential rejection in both close and casual
personal relationships. One of her primary coping strategies was to avoid humiliation or distress by impulsively
rejecting people at the slightest sign of
uncertainty. Gail’s mood was depressed
and her functional impairment varied
from moderate to severe. She was
hardly ready for termination.
Gail was making progress and had
recently achieved the goal of visiting
her children during the holidays. She
then interpreted her therapist’s attentive listening to the description of her
achievement as an indication that she
should terminate therapy. As they were
wrapping up the session, Gail abruptly
said, “Well, I guess this means we’re
done.” With that, she quickly left the
office without scheduling her next appointment. When the therapist phoned
her about rescheduling, Gail acted surprised. “I thought when you were quiet
for so long, that meant you were tired
of listening to me. Now that I was able
to see my kids, therapy must be over.”
Gail’s therapist explained that termination should not occur in such an abrupt
way, and asked Gail to work with her
on developing a clear plan and set of
goals for termination.
Oblique Termination
Oblique termination refers to a termination that is unilaterally enacted by the
client without discussion, explanation, or response to follow-up contacts. The
contextual cues offer little explanation and the therapist may be quite surprised by the client’s disappearance. This termination is abrupt, although it may
be preceded by lateness and cancellations. The “no-show” or “no call” and no
further communication create an unsettled dimension. The communication is
incomplete, and there is no message of client satisfaction or interest in following up at a future point. The behavior of the client is precipitous and evasive so
the therapist cannot adequately glean the subtle or contextual cues for the
client’s reasoning. The emotional undertone suggests a negative component,
but this is unconfirmed. This type of termination can occur at any point in therapy, but most often occurs after relatively few sessions. Possible reasons for an
oblique termination may be a provider-client mismatch, client dissatisfaction
with the provider or the process, ineffective or harmful therapy, some unique
Effective Termination 393
adverse reaction to therapy, poor communication skills among otherwise satisfied clients, or disruptive events in the client’s life that are unknown to the
therapist.
Case Example—Oblique Termination
Just as he got to his car after leaving his
third therapy session, Rick received a
text message from a family member
alerting him to a family crisis. His father, who lived 400 miles away, had
suffered a stroke. In the flurry of dealing with this crisis, he forgot all about
his next therapy visit. The therapist,
who knew nothing of the father’s illness, left a voice message following
Rick’s “no-show,” but never received a
reply. Unbeknownst to the therapist,
Rick decided he was just too preoccupied with dealing with his father’s situation to be in therapy, but might return
if needed at some point. He viewed
follow-up communications as rather
annoying, trivial, and unnecessary and
he was unsure what he wanted to say.
So he did not respond to the therapist’s
two phone messages. He figured, “I’ll
call him if I need him. That’s what he’s
there for.”
Unprofessional Termination
Unprofessional termination occurs when the provider fails to uphold reasonable
standards of conduct expected of a mental health provider. To label a professional’s actions as unprofessional is a serious charge, potentially career altering
or ending, and should not be done without a full understanding of all the information and relevant context. With this caveat in mind, we speak only of potential indications of unprofessional termination. Any final determination of
unprofessional conduct must be done with all the facts pertinent to a particular
case. Talking about clinical dilemmas among colleagues and peers is helpful,
but care should be taken to do this in a professional manner.
Unprofessional termination involves actions that are exploitive or capricious and damaging or potentially damaging to the client. The duties of professional conduct require that the provider has a rationale for termination that
falls within the scope of reasonable professional actions. The provider’s personal limitations, difficulties, or commitments may be a reason for termination
insofar as these circumstances impact the provider’s competence and ability to
provide safe and effective therapy. It is not unprofessional for the provider to
have human needs and limits. It is unprofessional for the provider to terminate
therapy to pursue personal gain directly from the client. It is unprofessional to
impulsively or abruptly terminate therapy because of being frustrated or angry
with the client. Further, it is unprofessional not to follow through in assisting
the client with understanding the termination, considering alternative resources, and having access to his or her record of care.
394 Basic Techniques for Clinicians—Intervention
Competence and Professional Standards of Care
What skills must the provider have to develop and use effective termination
strategies? Ask yourself what you think a clinician needs to know to effectively
navigate the procedures of ending therapy. You’ve worked hard to build your
skills for assessment, conceptualization, alliance, and intervention. What more
does it take to be competent in handling termination? Can you identify any
particular subskills for this important task?
A provider’s competence in handling the many challenges of termination
begins with an adequate foundation of ethical reasoning and familiarity with
professional standards of care (Davis, 2008). Contrary to the common belief
that providers should initiate termination only under the rarest circumstances,
current standards of care support and even demand termination in a surprisingly broad range of situations. Whereas termination based on reasonable professional judgment and procedure is an ethically sound and appropriate action
(Fisher, 2003), both clinical acumen and sound ethical and legal judgment are
needed to navigate the conditions of today’s clinical practice. To develop this
sound judgment, therapists need to have a clear grasp of the relevant expectations as delineated by ethical codes and guidelines.
Although each mental health discipline of psychology, social work, counseling, and so forth has its own official ethics code, the underlying principles
are essentially the same fundamental principles of beneficence and nonmaleficence, responsibility, integrity, justice and respect for individual autonomy
(American Psychological Association [APA], 2002; Beauchamp & Childress,
2001). The principle of respect establishes that the practitioner must appreciate
the client’s right to autonomy and self-determination. The practitioner makes
recommendations, but it is the client’s right to choose whether to accept the
recommendations or the therapy. Clients have the right to terminate therapy at
Case Example—Unprofessional Termination
Jennifer’s client Martina was starting a
new custom jewelry business and
wanted a partner. Not wanting to miss
this ground-floor opportunity, Jennifer
decided that the best thing would be to
terminate therapy with Martina so that
she could become her business partner.
Both thought this was terrific, since
“we already work so well together.”
The business failed, and both lost
money. Martina became depressed and
wanted to resume her therapy. Jennifer
refused, saying that she was sick and
tired of dealing with Martina’s lazy, ineffective behavior. When Martina requested her records to take to another
therapist, Jennifer said she would send
them but never did. Martina was upset
and angry over having lost her business, her investment, and her relationship with Jennifer so she filed a
complaint of unprofessional conduct
with the state licensing board.
Effective Termination 395
any point without notice. Unless it can reasonably be determined that the client
poses imminent risk of physical harm to self or others, the practitioner need
only take reasonable action to confirm the client’s intentions. If the client does
pose specific risks, the provider must take whatever actions are indicated under
state laws to protect against harm, such as contacting a significant other or involving mental health crisis outreach.
Beneficence and nonmaleficence are principles that refer to the practitioner’s
striving to provide benefit and avoid harm in working with clients. This is interpreted to mean that the practitioner only provides services that are actually beneficial to the client. If a therapist likes an intervention and believes it to be
helpful, that’s great. But the therapist has to remain somewhat of a skeptic, because if the client does not actually benefit, then continuing the intervention is
unethical. This point can be easily lost in dealing with painful issues when the
client is distressed and the benefits are not exactly clear. Nevertheless, it is still
up to the provider to ensure that the therapy is actually providing benefit. Similarly, if the client appears to be harmed by the therapy, it should be stopped.
Client perceptions of the benefit or harm of therapy should be checked regularly
and any perception of harm taken very seriously. These judgments of benefit
and harm are often difficult to make and are explored in greater detail later.
The contractual and professional nature of psychotherapy as a service distinguishes this relationship from other personal attachments. The provider is
both ethically and legally bound to adhere to the principles of responsibility, integrity, and justice in professional relationships, even though the provider is
still free to take the personal risk of being irresponsible, or discriminatory in
other nonprofessional matters. To competently handle termination matters, the
provider must be reliable, honest, and fair.
Every state has specific statutes (laws) as well as rules and regulations that
define the legal parameters of health-related practice, with the intended purpose of protecting the best interests of the public. As licensed professionals,
mental health providers are expected to adhere to professional standards of conduct as a function of the state laws that grant the license to practice. It is common for a specific professional ethics code to be adopted within the practice
rules and regulations of that discipline to establish a legally enforceable set of
expectations for professional conduct. Thus, the professional ethics code is more
than just a good idea or a suggested guideline. When it is incorporated into the
rules of practice, it takes on the force of law, and it defines expected standards of
practice within the professional role.
Across the different mental health disciplines of psychology, psychiatry,
social work, advanced practice nursing, pastoral counseling, counseling, and
marriage and family therapy, there is much similarity in the ethical codes for
professional conduct and the provision of therapeutic services. The actual texts
of the different ethics codes are a great resource for understanding basic professional role expectations in both routine and challenging circumstances (see
American Association for Marriage and Family Therapy [AAMFT], 2001;
American Association of Pastoral Counselors [AAPC], 1994; American Counseling Association [ACA], 2005; APA, 2002; National Association of Social
Workers [NASW], 1999). Together, they illustrate a common standard of care
within the professional practice of mental health care.
396 Basic Techniques for Clinicians—Intervention
Ethical Responsibilities Specific to Termination
If therapy is interrupted, providers are expected to make reasonable efforts to
facilitate access to alternative service (AAMFT, 2001, 1.11; AAPC, 1994, III.A;
ACA, 2005, A.11.a; APA, 2002, 3.12). Interruptions might be either anticipated
or unanticipated. Providers are also expected to make reasonable efforts to provide orderly and appropriate resolution of responsibility for client care in the
event that their employment or contract ends, with paramount consideration
given to client welfare (APA, 10.09). Dealing with interruptions usually means
offering the client information for locating other providers or types of service,
or providing a reference back to their managed care contractor for information
on their provider network. It does not mean one must schedule an appointment and go with the client to be sure the contact is made and that the client
likes the new provider.
In some cases, a conflict of interest or potential conflict of interest might
require termination with proper referral. A conflict of interest is any situation
that might “interfere with the exercise of professional discretion or impartial
judgment” (NASW, 1999, 1.06 (a)), or “(1) impair their objectivity, competence, or effectiveness in performing their functions,” or “(2) expose the person
or organization with whom the professional relationship exists to harm or exploitation” (APA, 2002, 3.06).
Providers are generally expected to “terminate therapy when it becomes
reasonably clear that the client/patient no longer needs the service, is not likely
to benefit, or is being harmed by continued service” (APA, 2002, 10.10 (a)). If
the provider cannot provide professional help and offers clinically appropriate
referrals that are subsequently refused, the provider is directed to discontinue
the relationship (ACA, 2005, A.11.b).
Providers are prohibited from terminating therapy for the pursuit of sexual intimacies with clients, relatives, or significant others of current therapy
clients (APA, 2002, 10.05; 10.06). Termination for the purpose of pursuing
other social or financial relationships with the client may be expressly restricted (NASW, 1999, 1.16 (d)), or restricted by the calculated risk of impairing the provider’s objectivity, competence, or effectiveness, or of exploiting or
harming the client (APA, 2002, 3.05).
In preventing exploitation or harm, providers also have a right to selfprotection. Nonpayment of agreed-on fees for services can be an acceptable
reason for termination (ACA, 2005, A.11.c). However, it is wise to ensure that
the financial arrangements have been made clear to the client, that the clinical
and other consequences of nonpayment have been discussed, and that the
client does not pose an imminent danger to self or others (NASW, 1999, 1.16
(c)). If the client threatens or otherwise endangers the provider or creates jeopardy of harm, or another person with whom the client has a relationship creates these conditions for the provider, termination is permitted (ACA, 2005,
A.11.c; APA, 2002, 10.10 (b)).
To complete termination in an ethical and professional manner, clinicians
provide notice and offer termination counseling prior to ending contact, suggest alternative service providers as appropriate (APA, 2002, 10.10 (c)), and
discuss the benefits and risks of options for the continuation of service (NASW,
Effective Termination 397
1999, 1.16 (f)). The exception to this provision would be preclusion by actions
of the client or third-party payers (APA, 2002, 10.10 (c)). The intent as we
understand it is to provide communication that fosters the client’s informed
self-determination, if that is not deterred by the client’s own threatening or
noncooperative behavior. Providers are not ethically required to provide termination sessions that are not approved by the third-party payer (insurance or
managed care). Many providers, however, do offer at least a single termination
session even if it is not reimbursed, as a good risk management strategy. Investing a bit of uncompensated time to support the client’s resolution is usually
well worth the effort.
When termination or interruption of services can be anticipated, it is appropriate to notify clients promptly and seek resolution in accordance with the
clients’ needs and preferences (NASW, 1999, 1.16 (e)). Pretermination counseling
should include: (a) advance notice of termination when possible; (b) discussion of
the reasons for termination; (c) an opportunity for clients to ask questions about
termination; and (d) referral information as appropriate (Fisher, 2003).
Client Abandonment
Many providers are confused about when or how they can appropriately initiate termination. Traditionally, mental health clinicians have taken an extremely conservative position based on the assumption that completion of
treatment meant a long-term course of therapy that could only end when the
client felt ready to depart. If a therapist ended therapy, it was considered abandonment, an egregious professional error. Thus it may not be unusual to encounter colleagues with circumscribed views on ethically appropriate reasons
for termination. “Once a patient, always a patient,” is the admonition, implying
that once a client is accepted, therapy becomes a noncancelable contract.
This adage of always a client has been mistakenly interpreted to mean
that the practitioner is perpetually responsible for the client and cannot ethically end treatment. The client is cast in the role of decision maker to the extent
that therapy cannot end if the client vetoes the action. Further, client resistance
to termination has been taken to mean that therapy must continue or the
provider will be guilty of abandonment. Together, the threat of abandonment
and the demands of the “in perpetuity” principle create a bottleneck for reasonable determination of when it is appropriate for the provider to initiate, recommend, or even insist on termination.
Many conscientious and compassionate providers unnecessarily fear making an inadvertent blunder due to a blurry concept of abandonment. The professional ethics codes offer no direct guidance on this issue because they do not
discuss abandonment. The laws governing clinical practice offer little additional
insight either, as one does not find any specific statute that spells out parameters of abandonment.
Abandonment is a legal concept that has been applied mainly in medical
malpractice cases where direct harm occurs from the physician’s failure to
complete necessary treatment such as chemotherapy. When this concept is
extrapolated to psychotherapy, completion of treatment has been equated
with the client’s readiness to quit. But the completion of psychotherapy is not
398 Basic Techniques for Clinicians—Intervention
readily definable and is highly related to the goals and productivity of the
therapy, concepts that are also difficult to precisely establish (Weiner, 1998).
In its literal meaning, abandonment refers to deserting or forsaking a duty.
A practical definition in the context of psychotherapy is the absence of a clinically and ethically appropriate process of termination of the professional relationship (Younggren & Gottlieb, in press). What is a clinically and ethically
appropriate process of termination? It is one that meets the professional standards of care and fulfills the duties expected of a mental health professional.
To meet professional standards, the provider is expected to exercise a level
of care and judgment that is comparable to an average provider within the
same discipline. A dereliction of the duty occurs when there is willful neglect or
action that falls below general community standards for reasonable or prudent
action. Practice statutes require conduct that is moral, professional, and honorable as defined by community standards of care. Abandonment can occur if the
provider fails to fulfill the identified duties at the level of community standards
and causes direct harm to the client as a result. Providers owe a duty to their
clients primarily in three areas: (a) to protect against known, imminent physical harm; (b) to create and maintain a professional record of services; and (c) to
conduct practice in a professional manner. Thus, a standard-of-care model defines an appropriate termination as one that addresses these three duties.
Termination and Protection from Harm
Practitioners are generally expected to assess for the imminent risk of physical
harm, and to take steps to protect any identifiable potential victim, including
the client (Fulero, 1988; Sales, Miller, & Hall, 2005). Terminating therapy without assessing for any imminent risk of harm to self or others can be abandonment if there is subsequent harm. If a client has a history of self-harm,
previous suicide attempts, or violence toward others, the average provider
would be expected to recognize the need for assessing this risk before discharging the client. Because emotional crisis can increase a client’s potential for impulsive and potentially violent actions, it is generally unwise to terminate
anyone at the peak of a crisis. The exception to this would be if the client is directly threatening to harm the practitioner (APA, 2002, 10.10 (b)). Termination
may appropriately occur at some point before a crisis is completely resolved,
but imminent risk of harm has subsided or further steps to reduce the risk of
harm have been taken (e.g., hospitalization).
Termination and Record Keeping
The construction, maintenance, and disposal of client records is regulated by
state and federal laws (e.g., Health Insurance Portability and Accountability
Act; HIPAA) that are designed to protect privacy and preserve the client’s
timely and effective access to this personal information. Failure to provide appropriate access to the client’s record can be construed as potentially harmful
to the client. Practitioners can avoid most if not all risks of abandonment of
client records by following record-keeping guidelines. This duty does not have a
direct relationship to decisions of termination, but it does apply to professional
actions posttermination. Client records must be maintained in a secure and accessible location for an extended period after therapy ends. State laws usually
Effective Termination 399
define the minimum length of time that secure records must be kept. The
essence of the duty is to make reasonable efforts to provide client access to
records and not to simply abandon the record in an unsecured, inaccessible, or
unknown location.
Termination and Professional Conduct
The third duty pertains to behaving in a manner that engenders public trust.
General standards for professional conduct require the provider to behave in an
orderly, predictable, ethical, and fair manner when offering services. If the
client is directly harmed by the clinician’s failure to provide agreed-on services,
this can be construed as abandonment. Providers are expected to do what they
said they would do and provide clients with a means of communication
throughout treatment. This includes establishing when and how to reach the
provider, what to do in case of an emergency, and what alternative resources
might be used if the provider is unavailable. This is not an obligation to be
available “on demand” to respond to the client’s whims and impulses, or to
continue therapy with an unresponsive, uncooperative, or hostile client.
A provider who cannot complete treatment, for whatever reason, has a
duty to assist the client in locating other resources. If further treatment is not
necessary, steps can be taken to draw the work to a close. Termination is in fact
an appropriate fulfillment of one’s professional duties when there is a conflict
of interest, the client no longer needs therapy, is unlikely to benefit, or the
provider cannot offer services of a sufficient quality to be beneficial to the
client. The client does not have to agree or even like the termination, although
it is certainly preferable to seek reconciliation of opinion. The practitioner is
not obliged to continue services until the client feels ready to accept the termination or until an unresponsive client improves. In fact, there may be a greater
risk of harm to the client by continuing unproductive or ineffective therapy.
Continuation of therapy is contraindicated when there is no benefit or there is
potential harm to either client or provider.
If termination occurs because the practitioner has been fired, downsized,
or laid off from work, the practitioner is not obliged to continue working without pay to avoid accusation of client abandonment. What providers must do,
however, is take reasonable steps to manage termination in a professional way
that protects the client’s best interests as well as addresses their own personal
and professional risks.
Applied Skills for a Sound Strategy
As noted, an effective termination strategy has two main components; an ongoing dialogue and a plan of action. Effective implementation of this strategy
requires certain applied skills. The clinician not only must know what is required for appropriate termination, but must also know how to do it consistently with skill and expertise. Successful, positive termination is not random,
but rather a function of systematically using the following applied skills
(Davis, 2008).
400 Basic Techniques for Clinicians—Intervention
Talking about Termination
Practitioners need sufficient technical skill and cognitive effort to be effective
in the role of therapist. They also need strong professional communication
skills to ensure that therapy begins and ends on a positive note. Communications about termination should ideally occur at multiple points throughout the
process of professional consultation, from intake and orientation to treatment
planning, progress assessment, and finally to deciding on a point of closure. To
be ready to talk about termination with confidence and authority, the clinician
also should undertake much preparation before the client ever arrives. This includes defining the limits of practice, setting a basic policy on termination, and
having a general plan to deal with limits, disruptions, or unexpected events.
The most important aspect of communicating about termination is to
make certain that it happens. Avoidance of the subject should not be the default
approach. Beginnings and endings are important, much as the takeoff and
landing of an aircraft are times of particular attention to fundamental tasks.
The topography of communication about termination (e.g., the frequency,
length, detail) will vary according to the client’s particular involvement in therapy. In uncomplicated situations, discussion about termination may be minimal
but strategically placed. In more complex clinical situations, the communications about termination may be more frequent, or may require more thought,
consultation, and attention to detail in progress notes.
For some clients and therapists, termination may be more difficult to talk
about than sex or money. This underassertiveness can have many components,
including the avoidance of uncomfortable feelings, awkwardness with the subject, lack of clarity on reasons for termination, or a fear of abandonment. Finding the right time to broach the subject and knowing what to say and how to say
it are all skills we expect the therapist to develop.
At the heart of difficulty with termination communications may be distorted beliefs about strong emotions. Both client and therapist may fear that
talk of termination will produce hurt feelings that cause the other to feel rejected. Either may fear the other will become angry or critical, especially if the
termination issues include elements of disappointment or lack of progress. Or it
may be that worry about emotional reactions is not a distortion. Talk of termination really will precipitate a firestorm of client affect, so the therapist avoids
the subject. Recognizing this tension is the first step in its remediation, followed by efforts to bring the topic into the discussion. Further information on
thoughts and beliefs that impede termination communications, as well as specific conversational targets, can be found in Davis (2008).
These communications seal the success of therapy. The provider always
hopes to create a sense of psychological order and productivity at termination,
regardless of the reason. The client’s autonomy, right to self-determination, and
responsibility to make personal decisions are always respected and encouraged.
Discussion of the client’s accomplishments, as well as strengths and opportunities
ahead, can reinforce a sense of dignity and value associated with participating in
therapy, even if the contact is quite brief. Doing this in a warm, respectful, and
encouraging way can also create a more positive experience with the provider
and with psychotherapy.
Effective Termination 401
Therapists who are having trouble with personal reactions to termination
should check their internal agenda. Some examples of troublesome personal
reactions include being overly directive, disrespecting the client’s autonomy,
feeling out of control or highly uncomfortable, personalizing the client’s desire
to end therapy, or feeling unable to let go. Clients might express fears of having
a relapse, doubt their ability to solve problems without the input of the therapist, fear disappointing the therapist, or are unhappy with the circumstances
surrounding the termination. These reactions can be examined within open
and supportive discussion as part of considering the decision to end or continue
therapy.
Develop a Practice Profile and Informed Consent Policy
on Termination
A practice profile spells out the provider’s approach to psychotherapy in terms
of competencies, philosophy of practice, and pragmatic aspects of service. Having clarity in this profile aids in concrete tasks such as creating marketing and
informed consent materials. Although it is not absolutely necessary, it is useful
to develop a written profile that specifies the types of service and populations
served, the major methods used, and the structure of the practice. Having a
written statement creates a framework of consistency for ongoing decisions
about the boundaries of one’s clinical practice. If these boundaries are clear and
specific rather than vague or ambiguous, the provider can better manage both
professional risk and personal stress. The written practice policy also ensures
having an adequate informed consent agreement with each client. Providers
who are working in a setting where the practice policy and informed consent
forms have already been developed and written by someone else will still want
to articulate their own statement of personal competencies, philosophy, and
pragmatic limits. Providers will also want to review their practice profile from
time to time to evaluate the need for updating or correcting any information.
Informed consent discussions usually begin at intake. Brief but explicit
discussion of termination at this stage can greatly enhance smooth consideration of this issue throughout therapy. Details of the provider’s policy on termination need to be clarified and preferably written into the statement of
informed consent for psychotherapy, including what to expect in terms of who
initiates termination as well as when and how termination might occur. Specific mention of billing or scheduling issues as triggers for termination may be
explained here, even if these points are repeated in other parts of the informed
consent document. Details of these policies may vary according to the provider,
agency, or practice setting. The following is an example of a termination policy
that is similar to those outlined by Davis (2008).
Example: Termination Policy
Termination of services typically occurs by mutual agreement when treatment
goals have been met, or when maximum benefit has been reached. However, you
have the right to terminate at any point. If possible, it is best to discuss therapy
termination prior to ending contact. Please feel free to raise the issue at any point,
402 Basic Techniques for Clinicians—Intervention
especially if you have concerns about the benefit of your therapy or are wondering
if or when it should end. If I think you might be better served by other resources,
including a more intensive level of care, I may initiate termination. I will consider
therapy terminated if you do not contact me within 90 days of our last contact,
have missed 2 appointments without notice, have a repeated pattern of cancellation, or if you otherwise do not comply with our agreed plan of payment. You may
contact me to resume therapy at any point, and I will accommodate your request
if possible. If you would like my assistance in locating additional treatment or alternative resources, please feel free to contact me.
An important part of this statement is the outline of a general plan for responding to common clinical situations as well as oblique terminations, thus
establishing parameters of closure. This nonpejorative approach emphasizes
client autonomy and self-direction and accepts the client’s right to terminate
without notice yet offers the opportunity to return or obtain assistance in locating other services. Assuming that clients terminate for many reasons, the
therapist creates a simple structure that acknowledges the possibility of this action, and encourages follow-up if the client wishes to do so. At the same time,
the client is informed of the possibility of a therapist-initiated termination.
Respect and Plan for Personal Limits
Clinicians overall are becoming much more attuned to the importance of attending to personal needs and limits (see Chapter 15). Therapist limits have important and direct implications for termination plans and practices. Sometimes
events in the provider’s life trigger a termination. They move, change jobs, bear
children, get sick, experience role overload, decide to shift career focus or retire. Therapists also have limits to their competence and may have insufficient
skills to address the client’s problems, personal biases that skew their ability to
work effectively with certain persons or groups, or may simply be minding
their own business when a conflict of interest lands in their lap. These circumstances are not always predictable or clear at the outset of therapy.
Competence or Conflict of Interest
Therapists must recognize when personal limits are interfering with the effectiveness of treatment and take steps to resolve the situation (APA, 2002, 2.0;
3.06), possibly terminating therapy. Many times, the therapist can take some
action to remedy the situation and protect the therapy relationship, but this is
not always feasible. Dr. Green is not likely to sell his house so that he can continue providing therapy to Mr. Smith, who has just become his new next-door
neighbor. Or, let’s say the deal falls through and Mr. Smith doesn’t move next
door but has a fundamental religious conversion and is “born again.” Dr. Green
may still need to terminate therapy because he cannot work effectively with religiously enthusiastic individuals due to his personal experience of emotional
and sexual abuse in a religious context. An overdeveloped work ethic can be
dangerous in clinical practice as well. Although most if not all therapists possess
a sincere desire to help, no one possesses the skills and energy needed to treat
all of the patients all of the time. All practitioners need to know the scope of
Effective Termination 403
their competence, and be prepared to terminate treatment if their personal or
professional limits have been reached.
Relocation
When closing or relocating a practice, providers will make provisions to either
finish therapy or transfer clients without abruptly withdrawing service. All
provider-initiated terminations require some notice, explanation, or pretermination counseling. Whether the clients transfer with a provider depends on individual circumstances and the options available. Providers first need to
establish whether client transfer is possible for the provider. Can they accept
the client for continuation in the new practice situation? Clinics or group practices do not “own” clients; they have the right to leave one location and obtain
service elsewhere, provided they fall within the practice profile of the new setting. Suppose Dr. Green leaves the medical center and opens a private practice.
His client, Mr. Smith, simply continues to work with Dr. Green in his new office. If Dr. Green moved from Florida to Montana, however, it would not be
feasible to continue working with Mr. Smith. Likewise, if Dr. Green stayed in
town but moved from the medical center to a job at the Veterans Health Administration hospital, Mr. Smith could transfer with Dr. Green only if he qualified to receive services at the VA clinic. Whether clients end treatment or
transfer to a new setting or a new provider will depend on their assessment of
the relative need for further therapy versus the costs of establishing a new professional relationship.
Providers are advised to check for any state-specific rules or regulations
concerning the relocation or closing of their practice, such as providing notice to
former patients. It may be that some form of public notice is required, such as a
posted notice in the clinic or a newspaper. The intent of such a rule is not to create one more annoying task for the provider, but to alert clients to the change
and allow the courtesy of access to treatment records. We hope that clinicians
want to offer an opportunity for clients to obtain a sense of closure, to communicate with the provider or the provider’s representative if they wish to do so,
and to correct any potential distortions or misinterpretations that the client
might draw in the absence of any explanation for the provider’s change in
venue. It is most helpful to leave contact information at the former site of clinical practice and to check back periodically to assist staff in redirecting inquiries.
Ending Practice
Eventually, all therapists end their practice. Ideally, this will be a well-executed
process at the end of a productive career. Nevertheless, all clinicians must anticipate the possibility of a more precipitous end or significant interruption that
could temporarily or permanently close a practice. Current standards of practice require that provisions are made either in the therapist’s will or as stipulated in a business associates agreement to name a qualified professional who
will handle the closing of practice, transfer of clients, and orderly management
of confidential records in the event of the therapist’s unavailability such as by
accidental death, illness, relocation, or professional unavailability (APA, 2002,
3.12; 10.09). Just as it is wise to establish a contingent guardian for one’s children, so it is important to have a qualified contingent professional to oversee
404 Basic Techniques for Clinicians—Intervention
the closure and possible transfer of a practice if the clinician could not carry
this out. Those working in an agency or group practice are most likely to establish this agreement within their employment setting. Those working more independently or in solo practice need to take additional steps to establish a
designated person for this important task. It is important to clarify the terms of
such an agreement with the designated person to minimize any potential confusion or distress for clients.
Uncertain Situations
Therapist illness or other personal compromise is a nebulous area that requires
advance plans. If you are sick or distracted, the feasibility of being sufficiently
available needs to be weighed against the level of care needed by clients and the
scope of your practice. It may be necessary to reduce or restrict your practice,
which could mean terminating some clients or services while continuing with
others. Here are a few examples of therapists who all have an active clinical
practice, but are facing personally demanding circumstances:
• Archie has long-term complications from diabetes and has to undergo
kidney dialysis three times per week, as well as monitor his activity level
and avoid contact with those who might carry contagious illnesses.
• Betty is in her first trimester of uncomplicated pregnancy, but is unsure
about whether she and her husband want to hire out infant care or provide full-time parent care.
• Calvin, an only child and sole care manager for his elderly parents who
both require assistance with nursing home and assisted-living arrangements, learns he has serious complications from Crohn’s disease. He not
only needs immediate hospitalization, but will also require multiple surgeries at unpredictable intervals, with extended hospital stays.
• Dionne, a horseback riding enthusiast, is thrown from her horse on a trail
ride, suffers a head injury with loss of consciousness and several broken
ribs, and is hospitalized for several days.
• Elvira reaches a professional crescendo when she learns that her largescale research grant proposal has been funded; she has agreed to advise
three additional students beyond her already full cohort; she has a new
course to prepare; she has just been elected to an office in her professional association; she has committed to chair two symposia at an international conference; and her spouse receives a promotion that requires
extensive out-of-town travel increasing her family responsibilities.
What should each of these therapists do, if anything, about their clinical
practice? Should patient contact be terminated? Of course, the first answer is
“It depends.”
Although it can be difficult for therapists to acknowledge that their own
needs and circumstances constitute legitimate reasons for termination, these
situations might all require termination. Therapists have an ethical responsibility to make appropriate arrangements in the event of their compromised availability or effectiveness. Decisions about what is appropriate are guided by the


client’s readiness to end therapy, and the availability of both parties relative to
the level of care needed by the client. Some clients will move toward ending
therapy if the current provider will no longer be available, others will readily
accept transfer, and others may take a “wait and see” position.
Of the preceding therapist scenarios, Calvin and Elvira closed their clinical
practice in response to changes in their circumstances. Facing immediate and
prolonged medical interventions for his Crohn’s disease, Calvin was physically
unavailable to see his patients. His continuing responsibility for helping his parents combined with his medical situation reasonably absorbed all of his mental
and physical energy, and the resolution of both of these situations was unpredictable in terms of length of time. He had a solo clinical practice, so a designated colleague took possession of the clinical records and assisted him in
contacting current patients to explain the circumstances and assist each one in
a decision regarding further care.
Elvira greatly enjoyed her clinical practice, but had to reassess her overall
academic, clinical, and personal responsibilities. There were simply not enough
hours in the day to meet her role obligations. She tried for a time to jigger her
schedule to continue her practice, but soon realized that even if she was physically present, she did not have the energy to be sufficiently mentally and emotionally present for her clients. She closed her practice more slowly than
Calvin, first declining any new referrals and informing current clients of her
practice closure with 6 weeks’ notice. Most of her clients found this sufficient
time to reach completion of their current treatment, with one exception. This
client had long-standing problems and wanted to transfer to an established,
full-time community provider who would be available long term.
Archie continued practice at a community mental health agency where he
could specifically limit his hours, and alternative providers were readily available in the event of a worsening of his medical condition. He was also diligent
in his self-care, doing what he could to protect his clients from unplanned terminations due to his illness.
Betty continued practicing throughout the duration of her pregnancy, and
made individual arrangements with each client for the period of interruption
for her delivery and maternity leave. She also established a backup plan similar
to that of Calvin for the possible transfer of her clients should she experience
any unexpected medical complications and be rendered immediately unavailable. She informed all new clients of her pregnancy, and did not accept any new
referrals in her last trimester. During her maternity leave, she decided to return
to practice on a limited basis, and to assess her family and work situation over a
longer period. She arranged part-time office hours for continuing clients only,
and did not accept new referrals until she had clarified her new practice profile.
In forming her plans, Betty consulted frequently with her colleague, Barbie,
who had return to work full time after maternity leave. Barbie continued her
practice with the assistance of a full-time nanny and backup babysitters.
Dionne, the horseback rider, thankfully had a rapid recovery without any
long-term deficits, not even a fear of getting back on a horse. Her assistant canceled all her appointments for the duration of her hospitalization, but no decisions were made until the extent of her medical condition was known. As a
provider in an independent practice, she also had a designated colleague who
406 Basic Techniques for Clinicians—Intervention
was ready to help her assistant with patient management in the event she was
incapacitated. Prior to returning to practice, she was medically evaluated for
any cognitive or physical impairment that could impact her overall competence
to practice.
As these examples illustrate, therapist needs and limits have direct implications for termination. Therapy must be terminated if the provider cannot assure competent, available service; advance provision for abrupt cessation of
service is a professional obligation to reduce the risk of client distress or harm.
Link Termination with Treatment Plans and Goals
Ending is not just a final decision in therapy; it is part of the overall goals for
what therapy is expected to accomplish. The point where therapy ends is a mutually negotiated decision that begins with the initial plan. Completion or discontinuation of the treatment plan is the most likely trigger for termination.
The clarity of the plan for termination thus begins with the clarity of the plan
for treatment. A client may have no idea when therapy should reasonably come
to an end, but a therapist cannot afford this same naiveté. If the therapist has
only a vague idea when the therapy should be concluded, it is likely that the
treatment plan is similarly vague. Difficulty knowing when to end treatment
can be addressed with more specific goals and objectives. A time line might be
useful when the treatment objective is to assist in coping with an ongoing stressor or development issue.
In dealing with a stressful work environment and mercurial boss, the
treatment plan might be to extend therapy over a course of 6 months at which
point the patient’s yearly work evaluation would be complete, and need for
further treatment could be reassessed. Or the treatment plan might be tied to a
specific behavioral goal such as completing a medical evaluation (for the
health-anxious client) or a stable mood state such as minimal depressive symptoms for at least 8 weeks.
Early in therapy, you can ask useful questions about treatment objectives
that pinpoint termination goals and orient the client to think about possible
points of completion. In the middle section of therapy, ongoing review of benefits
and progress toward goals is important to keep the interaction focused and avoid
unhelpful digressions. As therapy progresses in time, the question of ending versus continuing may be easy or may become more challenging. Clarifying the intended point of termination may be difficult, but particularly so if the purpose of
therapy has been lost, forgotten or changed. Throughout therapy, the provider
will want to include termination considerations in the client’s progress notes.
Early on, the provider can connect therapy goals with termination by asking the client, “What do you want to accomplish before we end our work together?” Or
the provider might ask, “When we have reached the close of therapy and consider the
effort a success, what changes have been made?” To bring the consideration of time
limits into the discussion, the provider might offer the following question:
“What is your top priority for the first 10 sessions?” Or perhaps, “If we have only 10
sessions, what are the most pressing concerns you want to address?” The client’s global
objectives can be assessed by asking, “Time limits aside, what would you hope to
gain before stopping therapy?” These questions can be brought up again as im-
Effective Termination 407
provements are made or time limits approach and the question of termination
needs to be reevaluated.
Other primary considerations that have an impact on termination can also
be discussed at this point. Simply asking, “Are there any barriers to your participation in therapy?” can open up a dialogue about factors that might precipitate
early discontinuation.
These questions can lead directly into an orientation to productive use of
therapy. The provider might ask, “Would you like to know how to make the most out
of each session and get the best results?” Presuming that the client will answer yes
to this question, the provider has a logical opening for brief socialization to the
therapy process. The provider summarizes the key aspects of the discussion of
therapy goals and closes with a statement of positive expectation for the work
ahead and its eventual outcome. The closing statement might sound something
like this: “I think I can help you with (reducing your worry and finding more joy in
life). Let’s work together as we’ve discussed and see what kind of progress we can make
in the weeks ahead. If our initial approach works as expected, that’s great; we’ll keep
going toward your goals. If it doesn’t, we’ll figure out what changes to make to keep you
moving in the direction you want to go until you get there. How does this sound to you?”
In a closing statement like this, the provider establishes confidence in
helping the client toward specific ends and an expectation that therapy will end
on a positive note. At the same time, it establishes that initial plans are not a
guarantee of results and should be evaluated for effectiveness along the way.
The agreement to therapy is not a commitment to striving for the sake of striving, it is an agreement to pursue certain results as long as there is a reasonable
expectation that they can be obtained.
Assess Progress, Benefit, and Potential Harm
Assessment of progress, benefit, and potential harm are all routine aspects of
conducting therapy. Bringing termination into these considerations is a fairly
logical step, particularly when it is time to request managed care approval of
additional sessions, or when it is apparent that the goals of the original plan
have been met. Pragmatic considerations require that client and therapist not
only ask, “What kind of progress are we making?” but also consider, “What
kind of progress are we making given the time we have available?” as well as
“Are we ready to stop yet?” and “Do we need to stop?”
There are several possible benchmarks for tracking progress and readiness
for termination (see Table14.1). Standardized measures such as symptom rating scales or structured interviews are wonderful for capturing major improvements, but alone may not always be feasible or sensitive enough for tracking on
a session-by-session basis. It is always important to be alert to signs of the patient’s possible interest in and psychological readiness for termination. This may
be communicated by direct statements such as “I think I’m ready to stop therapy for now,” by obvious progress in symptom resolution or tasks accomplished, or by more indirect hints or suggestions such as missing appointments,
arriving late, or engaging in a mainly peripheral discussion. Clinicians might
use any of the following benchmarks to assess progress and benefit of ongoing
therapy as well as readiness for termination (Davis, 2008).
408 Basic Techniques for Clinicians—Intervention
There are no clear benchmarks of harm other than specific physical harm.
It is potentially harmful to interfere with clients’ efforts to seek other services
(e.g., telling the client not to seek a second opinion). It may be harmful to fail
to suggest other options when treatment is not working. It is also harmful to
cause more problems than you are helping to solve. Any of the benchmarks of
progress happening in reverse should be cause for concern as a potential indication of harm: The client does not think therapy is worthwhile or getting anywhere; the alliance is strained or hostile and there is desire to withdraw from
contact; the client significantly destabilizes after contact; symptoms are getting
significantly worse in relationship to treatment interventions; functional beTable 14.1 Benchmarks of Client Benefit/Progress and
Termination Readiness
• Subjective sense of purpose and accomplishment linked to therapy sessions: Either one or
both parties have a sense that what they are doing has a valid purpose and that
they are getting somewhere. Clients make spontaneous statements such as “This is
really important,” or “What we did today really helped.” Readiness for termination
will be suggested by a subjective sense of having sufficiently addressed key issues.
• Productive alliance: Client and therapist feel as though they are working as a team.
Positive affect is expressed and the client shares important thoughts and feelings.
Readiness for termination is mainly indicated by a diminished intensity of desire for
contact.
• Stabilization or restabilization following contact: Some clients use therapy to focus their
reality testing and stabilize overall functioning. Readiness for termination is evident
when the client can perform these functions on a more independent basis.
• General symptom reduction: The number and scope of symptoms diminishes and a
range of positive affect is more apparent. Readiness for termination is indicated by
the client’s subjective sense that functioning is returning to “normal”.
• Focused symptom improvement: There may be discrete improvement in a focused area
despite other persistent difficulties, as noted by decreases in specific features of a
symptom cluster. Readiness for termination is indicated by the client’s assertion
that this change is sufficient, in the absence of any imminent risk of self-harm.
• Functional or behavioral changes, including improvements in role adjustment or performance: Important behavior changes are achieved such as returning to work, completing a feared medical test, or attaining a positive evaluation. Movement toward
these changes is noted in affective, cognitive, and behavioral increments across sessions. Readiness for termination is indicated by the client’s assertion of goal attainment and satisfaction.
• Improved family or other system functioning: Attention is focused on relevant issues,
and incremental improvements in organization, affective expression, problem solving, and communication are evident. Readiness for termination is apparent when
the needs of the system are being met and homeostasis is restored.
• Noting benefits in one or more of these areas is vital to an ethical practice: If there is no
benefit in any of these areas over a sustained period of time such as 6 to 8 weeks,
then ethically the provider is obligated to consider termination.
Effective Termination 409
havior or role performance deteriorates; or family and system functioning degenerates. The worst harm would be if the client becomes suicidal and takes action as a result of therapy, a development that would potentially constitute
malpractice. Indications of possible harm do not necessarily mean that therapy
should be immediately terminated. Efforts should be made to address the problem first. If these efforts to remediate the problem are not sufficient, the
provider may want to seek consultation before proceeding with termination.
Modify the Treatment Plan
Altering the treatment plan and renegotiating the goals as therapy progresses is
a necessary part of keeping therapy focused and determining a suitable point of
termination. As old problems are resolved, even older problems may surface to
take their place. For various reasons, termination may come up for consideration sooner or later than originally planned. Reviewing the conceptualization
and treatment plan can revive stalled therapy, crystallize new objectives or pinpoint the remaining tasks. There is nothing inherently wrong with extending a
treatment contract, and in fact, this probably happens quite often. The therapist
bears primary responsibility for negotiating and updating an acceptable and
workable plan and regularly attending to the progress, benefit, and readiness
for termination. These efforts can head off an oblique, complex, or unprofessional termination and increase the likelihood of a positive conclusion.
Pinpoint Typical Reasons for Termination
Let’s consider in more detail some typical reasons therapy comes to a close.
Reasons for termination vary according to degree of predictability, certainty,
salience, and amount of advance notice. These precipitants generally are related to practical, ethical, financial, emotional/motivational, and clinical conditions that are necessary for safely and effectively conducting therapy. As we
look at these reasons, keep in mind that both patient and therapist perspectives
are relevant.
The client and therapist might agree on the reason for termination, they
might negotiate an agreement based on their review of relevant information, or
they might be at an impasse if they disagree on the reason for termination. The
following are some common reasons for terminating therapy. These include
goal attainment, financial issues, practical circumstances, client actions, and
provider-client match. Further discussion of reasons for termination is provided by Younggren and Gottlieb (in press).
Attainment of Initial Goals
Therapy most often ends when the goals have been reached and the client no
longer needs the service. Client and therapist are relatively satisfied with the
outcome, and there is little disagreement or conflict over the decision to end
sessions. Client and therapist formed an agreement to work toward a specified
purpose, and that purpose has been achieved. The client’s goal might be a specific behavior such as driving alone on the interstate. Goals might also be states
of functioning, such as “able to work regularly”; or “living a more relaxed or
joyful life,” with some form of operational measures such as nonclinical levels
410 Basic Techniques for Clinicians—Intervention
of symptoms to demarcate when the goals can be considered reasonably accomplished. Particularly when a client enters therapy to resolve a crisis, the
main goal for therapy may simply be to resolve the crisis. The client may be
ready for termination as soon as the immediate distress is diminished.
Financial Issues
Providers are ethically obligated to establish an agreement for billing arrangements and compensation at the outset of therapy. If foreseeable circumstances
may limit services because of financial constraints, the provider must address
this as early as possible (APA, 2002, 6.04). The client’s financial situation is an
important parameter of therapy that must be objectively addressed. When financial limits are reached, it is appropriate to terminate treatment, to renegotiate the contract if possible, or to assist the client in transferring to lower cost
alternatives.
The client’s mental health insurance coverage might require preauthorization or limit the number of reimbursable visits. This creates a financial
limit for most clients. Providers usually keep track of the number of sessions
because it is the provider’s responsibility to obtain preauthorization and to
advise the client on changes in the payment structure that occur if authorization is denied. These circumstances could be considered more of a termination alert, as the client might be willing to continue therapy without
insurance coverage. However, this should not be assumed. The issue needs to
be promptly recognized and included in a session agenda so that provider and
client can decide together how they wish to proceed. Thus, the provider approaches the session with awareness that termination is a possible outcome,
and is prepared to provide pretermination counseling. In discussing the options, the provider needs to clarify the financial parameters of treatment continuation and assess the client’s willingness to agree to those new terms. If
maximum insurance benefits have been reached and the client wants to continue, can the client assume financial responsibility for additional service? If
the client has a change in insurance plan that shifts more of the cost to the
consumer, does the client understand and accept this arrangement? If not,
then termination or transfer is indicated.
Outstanding charges or the lack of a timely payment by the client are potential triggers for termination that should not be ignored. Providers who delegate business tasks to administrative staff need to provide enough supervision
to ensure timely attention to preauthorization, insurance claims processing,
and aging accounts receivables. They must also make certain that clients are
aware of the situation, understand their responsibility and are willing to comply
with the financial agreement.
The most emotionally stressful situation may be when the client has an
unpaid balance that must be addressed. In this circumstance, an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure. Timely payment behavior can be shaped from
the beginning of therapy to prevent the accumulation of an unpaid balance.
Providers should be sensitive to the possible exploitation of either themselves
or the client in the making and continuing of financial arrangements. There are
many reasons a client might not comply with fee arrangements, and it is incumbent on the provider to investigate the causes. It may be a simple misun-
Effective Termination 411
derstanding of when and how to make payment or of not having received an accurate or understandable billing statement. There may be contributing marital
or family communication problems because the client delegated the task of bill
payment to spouse, parent, or an accounting service, and there is a snag in the
third-party understanding, agreement, or execution of this task. Sometimes
clients do not intend to pay the charges because they are unhappy with the service, felt pressured into continuing therapy, think that the provider charges too
much, or have overall financial difficulties. Any of these reasons are important
to identify as soon as possible so that appropriate remedies can be implemented. If lack of payment precipitates termination, it is important that the
client understands this reason and has a chance to make prompt payment, particularly if the provider intends to implement formal collection proceedings
(APA, 2002, 10.10, 6.04 (e)).
Practical Circumstances
Practical circumstances have a significant impact on the client’s assessment of
the cost-to-benefit ratio for therapy. There are many costs to the client beyond
just the fees, and it is imperative to be sensitive to these circumstances. Time,
energy, and emotional or social support are also needed to effectively participate in therapy. Costs are relative to the level of available resources and are
perceived by the client in that context. Timing is also important, as the relative
perception of cost shifts when resources improve.
The clients’ assessment of the cost-benefit ratio is integrally linked with
their relative stage of change for the most pressing problems. The motivation
for change affects the client’s perception of the overall costs of therapy. At the
same time, motivation for change is impacted by the overall costs and available
energy. Some of the most significant aspects of therapy rest in helping clients to
assess their motivation for change and effectively titrate their efforts (see Chapter 12). It may be positive and appropriate to terminate therapy when the client
does not have the resources to move forward in the change process.
Clients with high role demands are often challenged to allocate time for
therapy. Despite the benefit of taking time to attend to emotional needs, those
with limited flexibility may experience significant stress in making and keeping
appointments, getting time away from work or home responsibilities, and having to make up missed work or arrange coverage. This stress might lead the
client to choose a different provider with a more convenient location or adaptable hours, or perhaps postpone therapy.
Emotional costs are also important in the client’s cost-benefit assessment.
Therapy takes emotional energy and there must be an adequate available supply. It may be appropriate to postpone or terminate therapy until the client has
more energy to focus on the tasks of treatment. If simply being in therapy
causes the client to lose emotional support or suffer increased discord with significant others, costs escalate. The cost may be too high if the client is getting
the cold shoulder, being interrogated, or is ridiculed for “seeing all those quack
nut doctors.”
Physical distance does not prevent therapy, but it adds to cost and other
risk considerations. There are several contextual elements to consider in determining whether it is reasonable to proceed if therapy requires the client to

commute a significant distance. Significant distance is relative to the norms of
the area and the specialized nature of the service. A general measure of significant travel is more than an hour of transit time each way. In areas with a low
density of providers or a lack of specialized services, there may be no other option but to commute an hour or more. In most instances, clients will self-select
the service providers who are most convenient or whose location falls within
the clients’ ability to manage transit time.
There are two types of circumstance where authoritative provider judgment is needed. The first is when there is an already established therapy relationship and the client relocates to another geographic area. Reluctance of
either party to terminate may result in efforts to continue therapy in some abbreviated or truncated fashion. Whether this constitutes a reasonable course of
action depends on several factors, including the client’s overall clinical needs,
level of functioning, emotional stability, the new distance, and the availability
of alternative resources. If the client’s needs suggest that greater access to a
provider is necessary, it is incumbent on the original provider to prompt the
client to establish a new therapy relationship by firmly insisting on termination. Despite advanced technology, attempting to maintain therapy via longdistance telecommunication or e-mail is fraught with legal, ethical, and clinical
risks. The lack of face-to-face interaction blunts the overall impact of the interaction (Nickelson, 1998). The client is less likely to benefit and the risks of incompetent service or other potential harm are increased (Fisher, 2003). The
legal and regulatory implications of client and therapist being in two different
states at the time of contact are murky at best. Without a current license to
practice in that jurisdiction, the therapist could be violating clinical practice
laws in the client’s state.
The second type of situation occurs when the client avoids more proximal
providers. Reasons usually include a concern for privacy, a desire to work with
a particular specialist, or a lack of confidence in local resources. These may all
be legitimate concerns, but each should be carefully considered in light of other
information. A stable client who is well known in a small town might travel a
couple of hours to a larger town on a regular basis, combining business, various health care consultations, and visits with family in the distant location.
Compare this with an unstable client who tends to mistrust any provider and
travels great distances in search of someone who will fulfill what are essentially
unrealistic expectations. Unstable clients present many risks, and these may be
multiplied when significant distance is involved. Not the least of these risks is
the difficulty of managing any emergency contacts when physical proximity is
limited.
Client Actions
Clients sometimes abandon their therapy, or they take actions that require termination. A client who stops scheduling appointments may have terminated
therapy. But this is not always clear, as some clients get distracted or have
symptoms such as anxiety or depression that interfere with the responsible action of following up. It is not unusual for a client to fail to show for a scheduled
visit or not schedule a follow-up, yet this is always taken in the context of the
client’s usual behavior, current issues, and overall progress. It is important to
Effective Termination 413
have a practice policy on no-shows and broken contacts so that the provider
can establish a boundary around client-initiated terminations. Sometimes a
simple prompt is useful in refocusing therapy. At other times, the client’s failure
to follow up is an indication of the intent to terminate. If the client could benefit from more therapy, the therapist can encourage the client to return. In our
managed care environment, it is now common practice to work with clients in
repeated segments of therapy where there may be multiple points of “soft” closure rather than a single point of final termination.
It is always useful to seek more information on the client’s intention and
to attempt a closing consultation. This may be impossible if the client does not
respond to reasonable follow-up inquiries. With clients who repeatedly cancel
and reschedule, the provider will establish the limits on what is tolerable before
declining to reschedule another appointment, as some sort of predictable participation is a necessary condition for progress.
Client actions that are dangerous to the provider create conditions where
it is unsafe and unproductive to continue the work. Termination is the appropriate response when the client makes threats to the provider or the provider’s
significant others (e.g., the client described early in the chapter, who threatened to stalk and harm her provider for not writing a fitness-for-duty letter).
Other examples include threats to sue the provider or take any sort of legal action, or any criminal behavior that targets the provider such as stealing or damaging office property.
Provider-Client Match
Termination may be appropriate if the client and provider are not well
matched, if the provider does not have the right skills for dealing with the problem at hand, or if the client has not established a clear plan for working with a
single provider. Multiple providers working with a single client usually function in an integrated manner, each contributing in a specific way as part of a
team. A client might work with a nurse practitioner for medication management, a psychologist for individual therapy, and a family counselor for marital
issues. Working with multiple providers at the same level of intervention (e.g.,
individual therapy) is counterproductive.
Clients often interview several therapists before settling with one, or talk
to someone for a second opinion. If clients schedule a second or third session,
they should be encouraged to focus on one therapeutic relationship and to terminate the other, or to explicitly plan a brief and directed consultation. The
provider must be careful not to discourage clients’ autonomy or right to seek
multiple opinions. It is important to discuss the therapeutic issues with clients
and try to reduce any confusion or conflict while helping them come to a decision that best meets their needs (APA, 2002, 10.04).
Providers want to encourage arrangements that help clients build trust
and emotional involvement in therapy, basic ingredients for effective work.
When a client consults a new provider, whether by choice or necessity, the
current therapist helps the client negotiate the process of termination, if that
is appropriate. The second provider will proceed with sensitivity and caution,
but may need to either help the client with the termination decision or
redirect the client back to the original therapist. The biggest quandary for
414 Basic Techniques for Clinicians—Intervention
relatively stable clients who simply want to explore a different approach, or
who should make a change for other circumstantial reasons is the interpersonal anxiety associated with leaving or “firing” the established therapist.
Talking this through will help most clients sort out their feelings and come to
a reasoned decision. Although the client has the right to terminate without
notice, it is helpful to encourage some closing communication with the discontinued provider, either in a session, with a phone or e-mail message or in
a letter, depending on the client’s preference.
When providers determine that they do not have the appropriate skills to
help a client or be effective in therapy, they should redirect the client to other
resources as soon as possible. Often this mismatch becomes evident relatively
quickly, during the first session or first few sessions. A mismatch can also become apparent later in therapy as new information becomes available or as the
client’s concerns shift. Providers who, after giving thoughtful consideration to
the option of treating a client, do not feel appropriate for the job should handle
termination tactfully and respectfully but remain firm in their professional
judgment. The client’s preferences, while they are important, cannot determine
the scope of the provider’s competence.
Six Essential Steps
All professional actions should be systematic and follow a consistent process.
The following six essential steps will guide clinicians through implementing
termination. These six steps will ensure that the provider has followed a clinically and ethically appropriate process:
1. Recognize triggers for termination. These were described in this chapter.
2. Review the clinical and emotional context. Begin preparation for termination
by anticipating the client’s potential emotional and behavioral responses.
Bear in mind that individual responses will reflect each person’s clinical
history and status, emotional propensities, coping strategies, and current
stress level.
3. Identify any legal, ethical, and contractual limits. Next, assess whether any
legal, ethical, or contractual circumstances affect termination. Some of
these circumstances are absolute in that the provider has little room for
judgment or negotiation. Others have some relative degrees of freedom or
room for discretion. A systematic series of questions ensures attention to
each critical issue:
• Are there any legally or ethically compelling reasons for termination?
• Are there legally or ethically compelling reasons to delay or postpone
termination?
• Are there contract issues that have to be considered?
4. Consider risks and strategies for risk management. No termination is completely risk-free, although most risks can be sufficiently managed, especially when approached with forethought and strategic effort. Different
areas of risk include adverse outcomes in clinical, emotional, and profes-
Effective Termination 415
sional domains. The client gets worse, there is emotional distress to the
client or provider, or the provider might be subject to legal action or professional discipline. The magnitude of any of these risks can range from
mere inconvenience to major fiasco. A combination of risks may also be
more than just a simple sum as a single risk may exponentially escalate
the magnitude of the other risks. It is worthwhile to consider overall risk
exposure along a continuum of potential for adverse outcomes to establish an appropriate level of intensity for mediating efforts. It is hazardous
to consider anything a minor risk, yet some risks need more vigilance and
planning on the part of the provider.
5. Provide pretermination counseling. Pretermination counseling occurs over
the course of one to three sessions that mark the end of a particular segment of therapy. There are two main objectives for this pretermination
discussion. The first objective is to provide notice of termination and discuss the circumstances. In this discussion, it should be possible to evaluate
the client’s needs, preferences, and options. The second objective is to provide a forum for the client to express feelings, to check perceptions, or ask
questions about the termination and to receive any helpful feedback or
practical information to facilitate the transition. There may be times when
client actions or the third-party payer’s limits preclude pretermination
counseling (APA, 2002, 10.10 (c)). Encouraging participation in a termination session is generally useful, but extreme or repeated efforts to contact the client are not usually necessary or advisable.
6. Establish the disposition and note in client’s record. Disposition can be established during the pretermination consultation, which might extend beyond
the final face-to-face meeting if follow-up contact by telephone is necessary. Notes on the termination discussion, with reference to each of the
preceding steps, are entered into the client’s record, including the closing
outcome. Any further telephone contacts should also be noted, as well as
possible written correspondence. Creating an adequate record of each step
taken is both an opportunity for the provider to reflect on the work and
draw a sense of closure as well as a basic professional task. If the client or
any other providers ever have questions about what transpired, the record
will reflect the degree of professional integrity that was maintained.
Prevent and Defuse Volatile Situations
Many risky or contentious clinical interactions can be averted by regularly following the six outlined steps. When snags or difficulties are encountered, it is
helpful to seek peer consultation for ideas and emotional support in managing
those challenges. This helps the provider to ensure that his or her decisions are
consistent with the community standard of care. What’s more, it is powerful
proof that the provider intended to maintain a high standard of care by making
this effort. Professional consultation on issues of risk management is essential
for any volatile, conflicted or potentially legally contentious situation. It is especially important to obtain consultation that is both professionally qualified
and confidential for matters of legal threat.
Several other general strategies are useful for managing emerging risks. A
practitioner who believes that a client is not benefiting from treatment still
should not terminate the service during an acute phase of a crisis when there is
any risk of self-harm. Instead, the provider has a duty to address the client’s
immediate safety prior to examining the suitability of termination, and to provide a reasonable referral. The provider is not obligated to retain the client
until a new therapy relationship is settled, as it is unethical and highly risky to
continue unproductive therapy with an unstable client.
If a client intentionally misrepresents basic information needed for therapy
such as presenting a false identity or fabricated clinical symptoms, termination is
warranted. The basic trust required for psychotherapy has been compromised,
and the therapist has significant cause to suspect the patient’s motives. Because
the therapeutic enterprise is based on trust (APA, 2002, Principle B) any action
that substantially disrupts this foundation becomes a reason for termination.
Similarly, many therapists would consider the therapeutic alliance irreparably compromised if the client tried to engage the therapist in a fraudulent action.
Requesting that the therapist make untrue statements such as an inappropriate
diagnosis for insurance purposes, billing insurance for missed appointments as if
the services were rendered, or making statements of fact that are not true to gain
disability reimbursement, entry into jobs or military service, child custody, or
any number of possible situations are attempts to conspire with the therapist in
commission of fraud, which could result in professional censure or possible loss
of licensure as well as other legal charges. If the client attempts to use therapy or
the therapist, the therapist must refuse to cooperate.
The psychologist’s ethics code allows for therapy termination if the
provider is threatened or otherwise endangered by the patient or someone associated with the patient (APA, 2002, 10.10 (b)). This standard of conduct is
broad enough to allow for judging a range of possible circumstances where the
best and most reasonable action is clinical termination. It also provides the clinician with a means of defending such action should the patient make retaliatory charges of unethical behavior. What constitutes a threat or endangerment
can include verbal or physical threats (Fisher, 2003). Termination under these
adverse conditions can occur precipitously, without pretermination counseling
or referral, and may include efforts to seek protective services from legal authorities if appropriate (APA, 2002, 10.10 (c); 4.05 (b) (3)).
If a patient or the patient’s significant other threatens to file a lawsuit or
professional complaint, it would obviously be preferable to try to resolve the
dispute prior to legal action. It is important to take all complaints seriously,
and attempt to fix the problem. If this is not possible, termination is indicated
(Younggren, 2004). If the patient has taken any formal legal action against the
therapist, then therapy should be immediately terminated with no further
communication and personal legal counsel obtained. As noted, consultation is
an essential step in managing any termination related to verbal, physical, or
legal threats.
Follow-Through and Follow-Up
If time allows, it can be helpful to reduce the frequency and increase the time
interval between sessions. This creates an opportunity for the client to practice
416 Basic Techniques for Clinicians—Intervention
new skills or continue self-directed efforts with decreasing input from the therapist. Termination is more gradual and natural, with sessions fading out over
time. There is time to process the client’s remaining concerns and diffuse the
initial emotional responses. Clients as well as therapists may experience some
emotional discomfort even with a reasonable and appropriate termination. It is
easier to end therapy when goals have been met, the client is satisfied and ready
to end treatment, and the therapist feels a sense of mastery in the finished
work. However, not all terminations feel complete. It is harder to end therapy
without time to process whatever regrets, frustrations, or anxiety might be associated with the termination. Discussing any feelings such as these is an important part of termination follow-through.
The fading approach also helps to reinforce a coping versus mastery objective in therapy. This is an opportunity to review with the client the specific actions, skills, or changes that have been useful, and to prepare the client for
coping with potential challenges ahead. The client might be encouraged to systematically schedule times for “self-therapy,” during which he or she reviews
issues, checks symptoms, pinpoints problems, plans homework activities, anticipates challenges, and schedules the next self-therapy session (J. Beck,
1995). Self-therapy might include adaptive homework such as weekly exercise,
regular social contacts, scheduled activity for pleasure and accomplishment, or
a “booster” visit with the therapist.
A common termination dilemma occurs when the client makes a bid for
some sort of personal contact or relationship after therapy. It is quite natural to
want to extend a positive interpersonal experience, so this should not be a total
surprise nor is it necessarily a bad sign. Because therapy is a personal service,
mental health professionals have a special obligation to be clear about personal
and professional boundaries to avoid any appearance of impropriety. The decision of whether to allow posttermination contact should be based on sound
professional judgment. Some therapists might disallow or discourage any contact following termination. Others might encourage contact, but frame it
clearly as a follow-up professional contact in a professional setting. Having contact of a social nature once therapy has terminated ventures into a fuzzy area,
where it is not clear if the contact is therapy or friendship or something else.
Any sexual contact is explicitly prohibited for at least 2 years following the
final professional contact, and even thereafter is apt to be highly questionable behavior (see APA, 2002, 10.08). Other social contact is less clearly defined in the
code of conduct (APA, 2002), allowing room for professional and personal judgment, or misjudgment as the case may be. Key aspects of this judgment involve
spotting reasonably foreseeable risks and taking action to avoid, minimize, or
manage any risk of harm to the other person. According to Younggren and Gottlieb
(2004), the patient’s history, diagnosis and level of psychological functioning as
well as the nature and length of the therapy are all important in determining how
the practitioner should manage possible contacts outside a formal therapy setting.
Summary
Effective termination does not just happen; it is based on a sound strategy. The
two main components of a termination strategy are ongoing dialogue about
Effective Termination 417
termination and a reasonable plan of action. The positive quality of a termination is determined to a large degree by how well the client and therapist communicate about this important decision. Terminations do not all look alike and
it is helpful to identify the good and bad variations. Six types of termination describe a spectrum of different endings. Premature termination is an unclear
label that often refers to ending therapy without a sense of closure or completion. Premature termination may reflect a therapist bias toward long-term over
short-term treatment. Prospective termination is planned in advance and includes a clear rationale and an opportunity to process thoughts and feelings
about termination. Prospective termination is typically mutually agreeable and
uncomplicated. Flexible termination is used when conditions require an interruption of therapy or when the client is unsure about the need for further treatment. Complex termination involves difficulties in the planning and
communication about termination and strong affect associated with ending sessions. Complex termination may be connected to personality disorders or secondary gain. Oblique termination is an abrupt termination that is unilaterally
enacted by the client with highly ambiguous or potentially negative emotional
tones. Unprofessional termination involves provider actions in ending therapy
that fall below a reasonable standard of care.
The clinician’s competence in termination is based on having a clear grasp
of professional standards, role expectations, ethical guidelines, and clinical
needs of individual clients. Applied skills are needed to implement the termination strategy and achieve positive closure under the varying circumstances in
clinical practice. These skills include the ability to communicate effectively
about termination, to characterize one’s practice and form a policy on termination, to plan for one’s limits and potential vulnerabilities, to incorporate termination into the treatment plan and goals, to systematically monitor and evaluate
client progress, to modify the treatment plan in response to new information, to
follow a systematic course of action when implementing termination, to manage the risks of volatile situations, and finally, to create a productive transition
and manage the outer limits of follow-up contacts without compromising professional standards or harming the client.

Self-Care and Ethics: Applying the
Techniques of Positive Psychology
Psychologists dedicate their careers to advancing the well-being of others
and caring for their clients. Like many other professionals, however, they
do not always practice what they preach. The profession is working hard to encourage psychologists to be mindful of self-care and to support those whose
self-care falters. This chapter identifies sources of potential burnout and offers
suggestions for self-care and for care of colleagues. We highlight sensitive topics and challenging aspects of therapy that are difficult to navigate with clear
minds, and even more difficult under fatigued, burned out, or impaired conditions. We explore clients’ and therapists’ vulnerable thoughts and feelings including anger, pity, sexual attraction, and identification, and their resultant
behaviors. We want to help new clinicians be alert for these aspects of therapeutic relationships that they might not otherwise expect, and to think about
the best ethical practices for managing these risks. We offer suggestions for selfmonitoring, self-care, pitfalls to avoid in therapy, and effective coping strategies
that emphasize the principles of positive psychology. Finally, we extend these
principles to the important matter of caring for colleagues.
Learning Objectives
At the end of this chapter, the reader should be able to:
• Describe the symptoms of therapist burnout.
• Identify at least three deterrents to confronting burnout or impairment in
oneself or for colleagues. Consider how to address these obstacles ethically.
• List at least five symptoms of therapists’ problems in reacting to clients.
422 What Every Clinician Needs to Know
• List 10 self-care practices for therapists.
• Describe how to care for colleagues.
• Explain how positive psychology relates to burnout.
In this book, we have explored why people become clients, and how to assess and treat a wide variety of difficulties ranging from mild distress to pervasive personality problems or antisocial behavior. We have considered methods
to encourage and instill change, monitor progress and outcomes, and recognize
difficulties in this process. This chapter aims to help readers turn this knowledge inward to prepare for self-reflection, self-evaluation, and self-care. To get
yourself thinking about this topic, answer the following questions: What have
you done for yourself today? What activities have you engaged in this week
that have helped you relax, laugh, and feel good? How regularly do you do
these things? Every day? Every week? Every month? Do you consider your
self-care, recreation, and work balanced?
Too often, the person in therapy least cared for is the therapist. Yet, clinical
psychologists serve as role models to many constituencies, such as students, colleagues, workshop attendees, and clients. It would seem that psychologists and
therapists should practice what they preach or help others achieve across the
biopsychosocial domains. Many of them do. However, therapists like all human
beings (including their clients), are susceptible to the stressors and challenges of
major and minor life events. Some have better coping strategies than others, some
have had better role models than others, and individuals’ ability to effectively
self-monitor and achieve self-change varies considerably. Most everyone can
think of times where they have responded to stressful situations in less than optimal ways. Can you think of times when you have responded to stressors (persons,
situations, or events) in ways that have left you feeling embarrassed, guilty, regretful, or more stressed? We hope that these examples have been exceptions
rather than the norm. Yet, when you are vulnerable, and the impact of the stressors seems unmanageable, increasingly irrational and inappropriate responses
often lead to personal and professional problems. Psychologists who are burned
out might have clouded judgment or skewed perceptions that could lead to unethical or unprofessional behavior. Alternatively, assuming a knowledge base of
ethics is in place, ongoing practice of self-care and maintenance of mental health
should increase the likelihood that ethical standards are followed and American
Psychological Association’s (APA) aspirational ethical principles are upheld.
Students are encouraged to learn the ethical obligations professionals
have in recognizing and responding to self- and colleague-impairment. Understanding the burnout syndrome and ways to assess this phenomenon is deeply
important for students in training, and following degree completion. Lack of
self-care can lead to burnout, and it, in turn, may to lead to unethical or unprofessional behavior. Therapists suffering from burnout might be impaired or exhibit problematic behavior.
Understanding psychologist burnout, psychological morbidity, high-risk
therapist behaviors, and management of personal reactions to clients builds
awareness of stressors, and ways to deal with them through self-care. The positive psychology movement has provided new ways to look at self-care and the
Self-Care and Ethics 423
prevention of burnout and impairment. Positive psychology prescribes self-care
practices to increase happiness, optimism, satisfaction, creativity, and moderators of stress for clinicians. Increasing positive thoughts, feelings, and behaviors
(self-care) may help decrease burnout, and maladaptive, and perhaps, unethical behaviors in professional practice.
Ethics, Impairment, Personal Problems, and Burnout
The Ethical Principles of Psychologists and Code of Conduct (APA, 2002), Standard
2.06 titled “Personal Problems and Conflicts,” offers the following guidelines:
(a) psychologists refrain from initiating an activity when they know or should
know that there is a substantial likelihood that their personal problems will
prevent them from performing their work-related activities in a competent
manner.
(b) When psychologists become aware of personal problems that may interfere
with their performing work-related duties adequately, they take appropriate
measures, such as obtaining professional consultation or assistance, and determine whether they should limit, suspend, or terminate their work-related duties. (p. 1064)
On first sight, these standards seem quite clear, but professionals also must recognize that many individuals who become patients or clients do so only after
negative consequences arise in their personal or professional life. Insight about
your own emotional or affective, cognitive, or behavioral dysregulation or interpersonal problems may be lacking at the onset of difficulty. How then are
psychologists supposed to self-evaluate their competency or impact of personal
stressors if their judgment is impaired due to stress, distress, or poor coping with
life events? When does having a few “bad days” turn into having problems?
Since the APA Ethics Code of Conduct is intended to be a guide that relies heavily on “professional judgment of psychologists” compared with others “engaged
in similar activities in similar circumstances, given the knowledge the psychologist had or should have had at the time,” (APA, 2002, p. 1060) there is a need to
look elsewhere to answer this complicated question or set of questions.
We begin with a discussion of impairment and problematic behavior as they
pertain to our professional roles. Judgment was discussed in Chapter 8, with
regard to biases and heuristics in clinical decision making, and a review of this
information would be helpful. The core competencies, and therefore, core curriculum expected of professional psychologists are detailed in Chapter 2 and
also warrant a review.
Impairment
The difficulty in identifying impairment stems partly from the profession’s difficulty in defining the term. The psychology literature defines impairment in
many ways, ranging from specific behaviors to broad individual characteristics
424 What Every Clinician Needs to Know
that hamper professional performance. A review of the literature (Barnett &
Hillard, 2001) summarizes distress and impairment as existing along a continuum, and referring to sexual misconduct, substance abuse, emotional, and
mental health issues. Barnett and Hillard also equate impairment to disorders
diagnosable on Axis I, II, or III of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental
Disorders (DSM-IV; American Psychiatric Association, 1994).
Without knowing exactly what impairment is, how can we know if someone is impaired? Furthermore, how can we help someone who might be impaired? Similar questions were asked of intern supervisors in counseling
centers known to be active in addressing supervisees’ competence problems
(Gizara & Forrest, 2004). These experts also had difficulty defining impairment. Their institutional policies also did not provide clear operational definitions of impairment to help them make this determination. Analysis of
interview content (Gizara & Forrest, 2004), revealed conceptual themes about
impairment suggesting that impaired interns engaged in professionally harmful
or deficient and persistent patterns of behavior. Supervisors related that impaired intern behaviors represented diminished functioning (change in performance), and deficient skills (broadly defined). Skills deficits included basic skill
sets (e.g., interviewing, delivery of therapeutic intervention), interpersonal
difficulties due to lack of self-awareness, and lack of professional responsibility.
Skill deficits represented the majority of examples provided.
Students’ attitudes toward impaired peers in clinical psychology training
programs were solicited in an e-mail survey (Oliver, Bernstein, Anderson, Blashfield, & Roberts, 2004). The operational definition of “student impairment”
(Lamb et al., 1987) was described as interference in professional functioning in
one or more of the following areas: (a) an inability and/or unwillingness to acquire and integrate professional standards into one’s repertoire of professional
behavior; (b) an inability to acquire professional skills to reach an acceptable
level of competency; (c) an inability to control personal stress, psychological dysfunction and/or excessive emotional reactions that interfere with professional
functioning (p. 598).
The definition was summarized to study participants to describe impaired
or problem students as those who “experience difficulties associated with interpersonal problems, substance abuse, Axis II disorders, and so forth and are consequently unable to meet the expectations of their programs” (p. 142).
Reflecting on this definition, students stated that impairment was most frequently evidenced by depression and other mood disorders, personality disorders or traits, anxiety disorder, eating disorders, substance abuse problems,
burnout, lack of timely preparedness, and interpersonal boundary concerns.
Impairment among student-colleagues and professionals negatively impacts
others within the profession, and those served by the impaired, therefore others’ perceptions provide important insight into shaping a definition.
At times, impairment has been confused with disability, as defined by the
American Disabilities Act. This term confusion is problematic because many disabilities would not negatively impact professional performance or delivery of
service. Because surveys suggest that it is unclear whether professionals and
students define impairment the same way, the term professional impairment was
suggested to focus on specific difficulties that may “impede or interfere with
Self-Care and Ethics 425
professional responsibilities” (e.g., deficient knowledge, limited clinical skills,
inadequate technical skills, poor judgment, and disturbing interpersonal attributes; Oliver et al., 2004, p. 146). Others (Gizara & Forrest, 2004; Kutz, 1986)
suggest that impairment should be reserved for describing diminished functioning, while those whose performance has not decreased, but rather has never
achieved sufficiency or proficiency should be deemed “not competent.” “Unqualified” might also be appropriate for this latter category. “Problematic” behaviors seem to be less well attended to in the literature and likely refers to
questionable behaviors that are borderline inappropriate. Problematic behaviors
that might warrant concern by trainers, supervisors, or colleagues often precede
impairment. If poor judgment leads to poor skill delivery, but does not quite
cause harm, perhaps the clinician’s behaviors are problematic. Likewise, students or professionals whose behaviors are interpersonally distasteful, abrasive,
or distancing among colleagues, but not among clients, might be considered
problematic within an academic or professional setting, but not grounds for discontinuance of practice. Practitioners who seem hostile, labile, or irresponsible
in ways that are not illegal or unethical might be labeled as problematic and
would likely benefit from early intervention or approach by colleagues or superiors. Problematic might describe subclinical or prediagnostic impairment.
A clear operational definition for impairment is lacking in the psychology
literature. Definitions vary from specific to broad, from focus on legal definitions to ethical considerations, from diagnostic categories to syndromes. The
seminal review article by Forrest, Elman, Gizara, and Vacha-Hasse (1999) concludes that the field of professional psychology defines impairment broadly,
with a focus on diminished role functioning of a qualified professional resulting from distress, burnout, or substance use, and sometimes resulting in unethical, incompetent, and compromised professional behavior. Burnout may be a
common cause of impairment, yet it is another poorly understood construct.
Burnout
Burnout has been defined as a “psychological syndrome in response to chronic
interpersonal stressors on the job” (Maslach, Schaufeli, & Leiter, 2001, p. 399).
There are three major components to burnout: emotional exhaustion, feelings of
depersonalization (detachment from the job), and self-perception of lack of accomplishment or ineffectiveness on the job. Maslach et al. (2001), pioneers and
forerunners in the field of burnout theory and research, suggest that stress is
captured by the construct of emotional exhaustion and refers to feeling depleted of one’s emotional and physical resources, and extended beyond one’s
perceived or real resources. Cynicism or depersonalization is characterized by
negative feelings and detachment from one’s job, representing the interpersonal context dimension of burnout. Personal accomplishment or perceived
lack thereof, represents one’s self-evaluation of job efficacy.
Qualitative investigations and case studies on burnout originated with a
focus on professionals in human services and health care workers, whose job
focus was on their relationships with service recipients and coworkers. Thus,
the importance of the relationship competency described earlier in this book
(Chapter 2) is highlighted again in the context of the burnout syndrome, in
426 What Every Clinician Needs to Know
which impairment in this domain of professional functioning is a key defining
factor. Early writings on burnout were anecdotal and conceptual, beginning in
the 1970s. Empirical studies on burnout emerged in the early 1990s, approximately 15 to 20 years after the initial introduction of the concept, partially due
to the development of objective measures of the tripartite phenomenon. Today,
the Maslach Burnout Inventory-Human Services Survey (MBI-HSS; Maslach &
Jackson, 1981) and the Maslach Burnout Inventory-Educators Survey (MBIES; Maslach, Jackson, Leiter, & Schaufeli, 1996) are two resources for psychologists’ assessment of burnout in clients and perhaps themselves. Other versions
exist for professionals outside human services and health care workers and educators. Interestingly, these measures do not generate a burnout “score” or rating; instead, the three constructs remain distinct factors of the overall concept
of burnout. Yet, these tools have allowed investigators to quantitatively research contributing factors, influences and consequences of burnout. This research led to more refined theory and understanding of the constructs of
burnout and their relationships to each other. Further explanation of emotional exhaustion, depersonalization, and personal accomplishment follows.
Although emotional exhaustion and/or job-related stress is a core component of burnout, stress and exhaustion alone do not constitute burnout. It is the
impact the stress and exhaustion have on one’s attitude, work effort and performance, and interactions with others that represent the construct of burnout.
Someone who is burned out might be stressed and exhausted, and therefore,
puts little effort into her client’s sessions, cares little about getting paperwork
done, and has trouble feeling energized about her job for an extended period.
This is different from the transient stress people may feel because they are running late for work or have an impending deadline to meet, and therefore, are
short-tempered or tired on a given day.
Emotional exhaustion prompts actions that emotionally and cognitively
distance the professional from the work, perhaps as a coping mechanism
(Maslach et al., 2001). Working with terminally ill patients is intense work that
some professionals might deem depressing or hopeless. Likewise, some professionals might maintain this impression of working with inner-city, abused children of drug-addicted parents. These professionals are not likely to choose
careers in working with these populations; this does not constitute burnout. In
comparison, professionals who choose to work with such clients or patients
might find times within their careers when they have a series of difficult interactions with patients, or have become invested in clients whose ultimate outcomes differ dramatically from what was aspired. Burnout theory suggests that
when many successive or simultaneous situations, or even one significant one
such as this occurs, and the professionals’ coping resources are taxed or not
buffering the job stress, they might inadvertently withdraw from other clients,
colleagues, or their job responsibilities to protect themselves from further disappointment, hurt, or frustration.
Undergraduate and graduate students alike often refer to themselves as
burned out toward the end of an academic term, year, or completion of a major
milestone (degree, practicum, internship, and dissertation). Can you think of
times in your professional or academic history when you felt drained and exhausted, despite getting adequate sleep? At that time, maybe you cared less
Self-Care and Ethics 427
about completing work in an ideal fashion than just completing it? Have there
been times when you postponed returning phone calls to classmates or coworkers, or have avoided other responsibilities related to school or work because you
didn’t feel like you had the energy? Perhaps you can think of time when your
frustration tolerance was particularly low, and you found yourself to be irritated with your professors or colleagues for what others might perceive as
minor wrongdoings or delays? While answers to these questions don’t necessarily indicate that you were burned out, certainly further self-reflection would
be indicated. Distancing seems to be an immediate reaction to exhaustion, according to studies on burnout that reveal a strong relationship between exhaustion and depersonalization, across settings (Maslach et al., 2001).
The preceding questions do not ask about irregularities in your eating
habits, mental acuity, or gastrointestinal functioning-vegetative symptoms
often associated with depression, which are less likely to be experienced by
persons who are burned out. In fact, professionals understand burnout and depression to be different phenomenon (Bakker et al., 2000). Research distinguishes burnout from depression in that it is job-related, situation-specific, and
limited to the work context, whereas depression impacts and is experienced in
all aspects of one’s life (Maslach et al., 2001). Persons who experience burnout
may not have ever experienced depression or other psychopathology. This underscores the importance of professionals’ and students’ ability to recognize the
key aspects of burnout within themselves and others, because it presents differently than the depression clinical psychologists are used to identifying. Although different from depression, burnout may still constitute impairment in
professionals who suffer extreme symptoms and manifest inappropriate behaviors consistent with this phenomenon.
The concept of personal accomplishment or job-related self-efficacy is related to emotional exhaustion and depersonalization in a more complex way
(Maslach et al., 2001). It appears that there are reciprocal interactions between
exhaustion and personal accomplishment, and personal accomplishment and
depersonalization. Chronic job-related stress might lead to decreased personal
accomplishment, and decreased personal accomplishment might lead, therefore, to increased depersonalization and exhaustion. Furthermore, if professionals are detached from their work and work relationships, it is unlikely that
they will experience feelings of personal accomplishment. The three constructs
of burnout possibly develop simultaneously, rather than sequentially, but more
research is needed to ferret out these relationships. Experts in the field suggest
that work overload and social conflict contribute most significantly to emotional exhaustion and depersonalization, whereas lack of relevant resources
likely contributes most significantly to decreased personal accomplishment
(Maslach et al., 2001).
The concepts of burnout and the burnout syndrome are complex. Many
practicing professionals are likely to have experienced or will experience some
degree of burnout during their academic pursuits, professional practice, or career at large. Yet, when do these experiences cross the line from “normal and
transient” to “dysfunctional” and “interfering” with professional judgment and
work, and therefore, ethically concerning? When does socially acceptable
burnout turn into impairment? Or, as some suggest based on a review of the
428 What Every Clinician Needs to Know
literature (Forrest et al., 1999), is there no difference between the two? While
exact equations or recipes do not exist to answer these questions, a look at the
prevalence of burnout and impairment in student and professional practice
might raise awareness to the possibilities.
How Common Is Burnout and Impairment in Training and
Professional Practice?
General statistics on the incidence and prevalence of burnout and impairment
in training programs and professional practice are difficult to quote with certainty due to limited reports of this information and variations in methodology
to gather such data. Studies mostly focus on specific subgroups of mental
health professionals and psychologists such as those who work with traumatized or maltreated children or adults (e.g., Azar, 2000; Collins & Long, 2003;
Sabin-Farell & Turpin, 2003; Salston & Figley, 2003; Stevens & Higgins, 2002),
substance abuse counselors (e.g., Mack, 2004; Shoptaw, Stein, & Rawson,
2000), older adults (e.g., Spear, Wood, Chawla, Devis, & Nelson, 2004), or
those practicing outside the United States (Brown, Prashantham, & Abbott,
2003). Studies examining correlates and factors related to burnout and impairment might underestimate the prevalence and incidence of these phenomena
due to self-selection biases. Many of those who participate might be willing to
do so because they are not feeling particularly stressed or burned out. However, several review articles and studies have attempted to summarize more
general findings from objective sources.
Based on the four studies of rates of impairment in training that were
conducted between 1982 and 1991, more than two-thirds of all surveyed programs reported having at least one impaired student within the 5 years prior to
study participation (Forrest et al., 1999). Furthermore, data suggest that all
programs identified at least one impaired student each year for the 5-year period (Forrest et al., 1999).
In a more recent professional competence survey of 71 representatives of
graduate programs in clinical, school, or counseling psychology, almost half of
the respondents reportedly had at least one student with limited clinical skills.
Personality and emotional problems were frequently the cause of this problem
(Procidano, Busch-Rossnagel, Reznikoff, & Geisinger, 1995). A large majority
of respondents (89%) had experience with at least one student who exhibited
nonacademic or professional deficiencies (Procidano et al.). Similar statistics
were provided by department heads of American Psychological Associationaccredited professional psychology training programs, suggesting that two to
three impaired students per program were identified within a 5-year period
(Schwebel & Coster, 1998).
Self-reports of professional psychology students’ perception of impairment or burnout are limited. However, an exploratory study of over 1,000 clinical psychology graduate students (mostly female) showed that approximately
75% of these students, most of whom were in PhD programs, had received psychotherapy for various reasons (personal growth, impairment, family issues,
adjustment, etc.) at some time either during or prior to graduate studies. A
closer look at statistics related to impairment revealed varied reasons for seek-
Self-Care and Ethics 429
ing therapy. Over half the respondents sought therapy for depression, or “adjustment or developmental issues.” Another 20% of the sample sought therapy
for problems with spouse or significant other, or for other interpersonal issues.
Finally, just under 10% sought therapy for suicidal ideation; eating disorders;
physical assault, abuse, or sexual abuse; or substance abuse (Holzman,
Searight, & Hughes, 1996). Respondents rarely told their supervisors they were
in therapy. Assuming the findings are generalizable, these results suggest,
therefore, that training directors’ reports of impairment, burnout, or students’
“problems” might underrepresent the frequency in which students experience
such difficulties. This disparity also highlights the possibility that not all experiences of depression or other mental health concerns by students and professionals result in impairment or diminished functioning by practitioners, despite
the frequency with which these phenomena apparently occur.
In professional practice, early studies show that many professional psychologists experience psychological distress, and continue to work while
doing so (Guy, Poelstra, & Stark, 1989; Pope et al., 1987). In fact, in a study of
456 practicing psychologists, approximately 60% reported that they continued to work despite being too distressed to function effectively (Pope et al.,
1987). You can probably think of a time when you or some friends were so
stressed out that you had trouble paying attention in class, or maybe didn’t
perform as well on an exam because you were distracted, so these statistics
seem reasonable. When considering the changes in judgment, attention, concentration, and memory people tend to experience under distress, it is frightening to think of the potential negative impact psychologists could have on
their clients as a result.
In a survey study of 304 Tennessee psychologists, respondents estimated
that 19% of their colleagues had psychological conditions (including substance
abuse) that rendered them impaired in their practice (Floyd, Myszka, & Orr,
1998). Respondents reportedly had concerns that at least one or two colleagues
were impaired at the time of survey. When asked to think about the past year,
psychologists estimated that nearly 30% of their colleagues suffered impairment in that time frame. While people knew of more psychologists with substance abuse problems, impairment was perceived to result more frequently
from psychological problems. Respondents’ reported (in order of frequency)
overwork, personality disorders, emotional or mental illnesses, and health or
age effects, as other problem areas for colleagues.
In parallel to the students’ self-reported experiences with therapy, which
provides another perspective of incidence of psychological problems or impairment, a survey of 425 members of the Counseling Psychology division (Division 17) of the American Psychological Association was conducted on personal
experiences with depression and treatment (Gilroy, Carroll, & Murra, 2002).
Slightly more than half of this sample identified themselves as being employed
in private practice. More than half of the respondents identified themselves as
depressed. Of the 114 who recall receiving formal diagnoses during therapy, approximately one-third were diagnosed with dysthymia, one-third with adjustment disorder with depressed mood, and about 10% had a major depressive
disorder or bipolar disorder; almost half of the sample reported experiencing
some form of suicidal ideation or behavior (Gilroy et al., 2002). Although some
430 What Every Clinician Needs to Know
of the depressed participants perceived their depression as having a positive impact on their clinical work by increasing empathy and effectiveness, the majority thought their depression impacted their work negatively. Feeling depressed
led these counselors to have reduced energy, be less productive, feel distracted,
experience decreased patience and confidence, be less emotionally available,
and feel burned out (Gilroy et al., 2002). Of course, these findings may not be
generalizable due to limited sample sizes and the self-selection process inherent in survey studies.
How Does the Profession Handle Impaired or Burned-Out
Trainees and Professionals?
Even though professional deficiencies and impairment can be difficult to identify and ameliorate (Procidano et al., 1995), clinical training programs (graduate programs, predoctoral and postdoctoral internships) frequently need to
address these issues with students. The Ethics Code (APA, 2002) mandates selfidentification of diminished functioning and self-referral for assistance in recovering from such difficulties. Yet, many barriers prevent students and
professionals from seeking assistance from their training programs or colleagues for personal problems.
Students might fear losing their careers or being stigmatized by professors
and classmates if they admit to personal deficiencies or impairment. Professionals might also fear stigmatization or have difficulty identifying or admitting
their own need for help. Also, avoiding dual relationships can be challenging in
professionals’ search for a therapist or supervisor to help them remediate deficiencies or impairment. Practitioners in rural areas or those who are highly visible in professional organizations might encounter this difficulty most often.
For students, programs often limit the time for degree completion, and
leaves of absence or remediation work could delay meeting program milestones. Admitting deficiencies, therefore, if others have not identified them,
can present a dilemma for the student whose decision making might already be
impaired. Professionals may similarly have financial burdens that present obstacles to them taking a temporary break from providing client services to
allow time for self-care and remediation. Other reasons students or professionals might not seek help include self-doubt, unrealistic expectations for what
one should be able to handle, and what others expect of them. Training programs and personal philosophical orientations, practices, and social climates
might foster outreach, or might prohibit it.
As the literature review on personal therapy during training has revealed, in many situations self-identification and self-referral for personal
problems do not occur. Training programs have at least some responsibility for
aiding students in identifying problematic behaviors and impairment, and developing remediation plans. When remediation plans are unsuccessful, termination is often the only outcome.
Few studies or articles detail the types of remediation plan used for students (Forrest et al., 1999), and even fewer can be found for practicing professionals (Koocher & Keith-Spiegel, 1998). Training programs often recommend
personal therapy, repeat practicum, extra or repeated coursework, leave of absence, increased supervision, tutoring, growth groups, or students leaving their
Self-Care and Ethics 431
programs (Forrest et al., 1999). While personal therapy was the most common
remediation action taken in Forrest’s review, this intervention is somewhat
controversial among training program philosophies and directors, based on ethical guidelines. Recommending personal therapy is controversial because
trainees might be resistant to seeking treatment; the trainees’ privacy might be
compromised or they might perceive it to be so; mandating personal therapy
may be considered a boundary violation in the student-supervisee relationship;
therapists have conflicting roles in servicing the student and communicating
with the program about progress; program involvement may interfere with the
therapeutic relationship; and therapy does not guarantee remediation of
trainee deficiencies (Forrest et al., 1999).
Based on the limited literature, it is advisable for remediation plans to be
goal-focused and problem-solving oriented. The identified problems and the
proposed solutions or remediation plans should be obviously linked. Steps for
remediation should be detailed and behavioral so that progress and change can
be monitored and students and training supervisors have objective understandings of what is expected. Students and trainers would also benefit from
prospectively outlining consequences of successful and unsuccessful completion of these plans. While these recommendations make intuitive sense, little is
offered in the literature to document the frequency of clearly delineated policies, procedures, remediation plans, or outcomes.
The frequency of student dismissal is an outcome that has been empirically surveyed. According to a review of several studies, most programs reportedly have separated or dismissed at least one student within a 3-year time
period as a last resort for any of the following reasons: inadequate clinical
skills, deficient interpersonal skills, supervision difficulties, unprofessional demeanor, personality disorder, emotional problems, and academic dishonesty.
These statistics underscore the prevalence of such difficulties even at the training level. Much like the profession as a whole, much work is needed to improve
remediation procedures, documentation, and report of outcomes.
Practicing professionals, especially those in private practice, are often not
directly accountable to supervisors or administrators. They are responsible to
society, the profession, and the clients to maintain their own competence and
well-functioning. This presupposes a high degree of self-monitoring, and allows limited opportunity for identification of impairment by others beyond
their service recipients. Formal remediation programs for impaired psychologists are rare, although colleague assistance programs are increasingly available
on a state-by-state basis.
If not by self-referral and intrinsic motivation, then how do professionals
enter into remediation for impairment or personal problems? If not selfmotivated, professionals might be sanctioned by state licensing boards to engage in therapy, additional supervision, or suspension of providing services, if
found guilty of problematic, illegal, or unethical behavior. Other actions taken
by state boards, depending on the severity of misconduct or consequence to impaired or unethical behavior may include educative or warning letters, reprimanding letters, directives to take specific corrective action as dictated by the
regulatory board, or even revocation of licensure. Notice, however, that these
actions occur based on behaviors and evidence of impairment or misconduct,
rather than on the proactive approaches that are more easily taken in training
432 What Every Clinician Needs to Know
programs before damage occurs. Ideally, identification of professional impairment occurs by self or colleagues before consumers are affected.
The Ethics Code (APA, 2002) provides guidelines outlining the responsibility of professionals to confront colleagues directly before pursuing official
means of intervention for impairment. Standard 1.04 “Informal Resolution of
Ethical Violations” states:
When psychologists believe that there may have been an ethical violation by another psychologist, they attempt to resolve the issue by bringing it to the attention
of that individual, if an informal resolution appears appropriate and the intervention does not violate any confidentiality rights that may be involved. (p. 1063)
If the preceding actions do not resolve the situation, Ethical Standard 1.05
(Reporting Ethical Violations) states “psychologists take further action appropriate to the situation. Such actions might include referral to state or national
committees on professional ethics, to state licensing boards, or to the appropriate institutional authorities” (p. 1063).
For recipients of services (clients, patients, students), the procedures are
probably less well known by the public, and actions are most likely pursued
through lawyers or the help of other psychologists. Such actions are probably
less likely to occur due to the individuals’ own personal problems that sent
them to a psychologist in the first place! There are few formalized ways to address problematic behaviors in practicing professionals before the behaviors become evidence of impairment.
The legal and ethical mechanisms described are in place to protect the
public from unlawful, incompetent, and unethical actions by psychologists
(Koocher & Keith-Speigel, 1998). The relationship between law and ethics is
complex, but neither tolerates impaired functioning. Unlike privacy afforded in
graduate training programs that protects students from having other students
know about their personal situations, actions taken by legal and ethical bodies
in the profession of psychology are often public and published. Thus, selfregulation is critical to self-preservation, as are support and encouragement for
and of others. Self-regulation and support are the best forms of prevention.
Awareness of due process procedures and policies outlined by the APA in their
Ethics Code (2002), and in state licensing guidelines is also important. These
documents inform professionals and consumers about the consequences for
professionals engaging in misconduct or whose impairment is negatively impacting clients. This information, much like that for trainees, can motivate or
inhibit colleagues and consumers from reporting impaired psychologists.
Therapists’ Reactions to Clients: Normal to Problematic and
What to Do about It
In your past week, what emotions have you experienced? Have you been excited? Elated? Anxious? Nervous? Compassionate? Empathic? Fearful? Con-
Self-Care and Ethics 433
cerned? Worried? Angry? Aggressive? Responsible? Embarrassed? Competitive?
Avoidant? Aggravated? Frustrated? Relaxed? Talkative? Overwhelmed with love
or attraction for someone? Have you had intrusive thoughts of self-assured success or defeat? Jealous thoughts? Fantasies about what life would be like if ...?
All these are commonly experienced emotions, feelings, and thoughts. Yet, are
they positive or negative? Appropriate or not? The answer depends largely on the
frequency, intensity, and circumstances in which they are experienced, and the
resultant behavior.
It is appropriate to feel somewhat anxious about a job interview or traveling to a new place, but if that anxiety prevents you from presenting yourself as
well as you might have otherwise, or if it interferes with your ability to arrive
at the destination of choice, the anxiety might be considered excessive or problematic. The behaviors that result might be displays of insecurity or negatively
affected communication or physiological functioning, for example, loss of
train-of-thought, stuttering, distraction, avoidance, sweatiness, or heart palpitations. For others, the intensity of anxiety in these situations might be uncomfortable, but their coping strategies might prevent their anxiety from negatively
affecting their behaviors or outward appearance. These individuals may continue to function without consequence.
Thus, in discussing therapists’ reactions to clients, it is important to recognize that like any other person, therapists will experience a wide range of emotions in response to their clients’ stories, symptoms, appearance, personalities,
therapy behaviors (compliance, participation, honesty), and other variables.
This is normal and expected. The key, however, is being self-aware of the
thoughts, feelings, and behaviors one has in relation to each client, and populations as a whole so that self-monitoring occurs; supervision or assistance can be
sought, if needed; and appropriate therapist-client relations and boundaries are
maintained. Sounds easy and obvious, right? The following illustrations are actual situations that have occurred for trainees or professionals in the field, with
identifying information disguised for protection. Consider how you might
think, feel, and act if you were in the position of the trainee or therapist.
Clinical Example: Mina and Her “Rescue”
Mina is a third-year doctoral student in
clinical psychology. She has succeeded
in school through undergraduate training, but always felt pressured to achieve
a doctoral degree due to her parents’
academic achievements. In her doctoral
training, Mina struggled with certain
aspects of the curriculum, and with
balancing school, personal life, and her
part-time job. She had several meetings
with faculty to address her disorganization, lack of follow-through, and academic difficulty that put her in jeopardy of not progressing in the program.
She experienced feelings of depression
and intermittent anxiety.
In her practicum, she assessed a
20-year-old female, Rachel who had a
similar background. Rachel had failed
conversational Italian and was seeking
an evaluation of a possible learning disability to validate her appeal to the college to expunge her grade because it
resulted from a self-reported language
(continued)
434 What Every Clinician Needs to Know
Clinical Example: Mina and Her “Rescue” (Continued)
disability. After extensive history taking
and testing, Mina concluded that while
the tests did not actually confirm a language disability, they did not entirely
disconfirm this claim either. Also, Rachel
appeared to have some organizational
difficulties and stressors that might
ave interfered with her successful performance. Considering Rachel’s family
pressure to graduate with honors, and
the unlikely chance that this would result if the grade remained, Mina felt inordinate pressure to produce results
consistent with Rachel’s pleas for help.
Mina felt badly for Rachel and the feelings she expressed about her parents’
reactions. Since the data was unclear,
Rachel felt conflicted and inclined to
highlight (possibly embellish) the difficulties Rachel experienced with recommendations to give her a waiver exam
and accommodations for a reexamination that would dismiss her previous
grade. After all, testing was imperfect
and therefore, how could she say for certain that Rachel’s self-assessment wasn’t
accurate?
Points to Ponder: What would be appropriate steps for Mina to take on concluding her evaluation? How could she identify
the potential for her emotions to dictate her
professional judgment and behavior?
Clinical Example: Lola and the Hug
Lola was a third-year doctoral student
who had little clinical experience prior
to beginning her graduate studies. Her
previous career was as a resource room
teacher in an elementary school. During Lola’s practicum training year in a
community mental health setting, she
had few returning clients and little success with the few ongoing cases she
had. She was overwhelmed by her
sense of responsibility for her clients’
well-being, and her need to recall didactic information to apply it in clinical
situations. She often felt stressed and
exhausted by these perceived demands,
until she was assigned to work with
a 10-year-old boy, Brad, who was having behavioral problems at home. The
child’s mother had four other younger
children and was often stressed and upset about Brad’s poor behavior, which
often led her to frustration and angry
outbursts instead of the scheduled behavioral plan she was to follow. After
the fourth session, Brad’s mother reported success with the behavior plan
during their vacation week. Lola was so
pleased by the mother’s report that she
jumped up in session, hugged her and
overzealously expressed her joy. For
the first time in this placement, Lola
felt like she had succeeded in her therapeutic efforts and that she was competent to practice what she had been
learning. In contrast, Brad’s mother
was too stunned to respond to her hug,
did not hug her back, and canceled
their next session.
Points to Ponder: What were some of
the possible antecedents that led to Lola’s
hug? Consider her thoughts, feelings, beliefs,
and behavior; consider those of the mother.
Whose needs were served by Lola’s hugging
the client? What are some other possible
ways that Lola could have expressed her satisfaction to Brad’s mother? What cues could
have helped Lola identify her vulnerability
to acting inappropriately with this client?
Self-Care and Ethics 435
Clinical Example: Andy and the Never-Ending
Client Commitment
Andy had worked as a clinical psychologist for 10 years. His income was generated from private practice, adjunct
teaching, consultation, and executive
job coaching. In the summertime, Andy
was referred a new client from a
previous client. Joanie, a 42-year-old
administrative assistant, had a longstanding history of severe depression
that she attributed to genetics (maternal side) and to being raised by an uncaring, demeaning, alcohol-abusing
mother and mostly silent father. Andy
identified early in the assessment process that Joanie lacked specific adaptive
coping skills and had maladaptive and
dysfunctional thoughts and belief patterns, for which he outlined a specific
cognitive behavioral approach to treatment. Joanie, however, seemed more
interested in venting and whining
about her problems each session, was
help-rejecting of suggestions made by
Andy, and was noncompliant with
homework. Andy monitored Joanie’s
depression and anxiety with standardized self-report questionnaires, and
found that she had not improved at all
in four sessions. Joanie committed only
to biweekly sessions, and canceled her
appointments fairly often. Andy often
found himself either bored during her
sessions, in which he would find his
mind wandering during her complaint
monologues, or he found himself angry
and irritated by her unwillingness to
make efforts to change her situation.
She argued that others were the cause
of her problems, or that she simply did
not have time to do Andy’s homework
between sessions even if she did think
they would be helpful. Quickly, he
became less active in the sessions and
discontinued assigning homework or
practice exercises. Joanie claimed that
she felt better after her sessions, despite
her lack of improvement according to
the outcome measures or her display of
affect. Andy’s client census was low,
and despite his frustration with her,
and his wish prior to sessions that she
would not actually present for therapy,
he continued to allow her to be enrolled as a client and scheduled regular
sessions with her.
Points to Ponder: Andy expresses feelings of frustration, anger, and boredom
with Joanie. How do these feelings possibly
affect his practice of therapy with her?
What are the potential consequences to her
as a client? What are some of the other motivating factors for Andy to continue to
work with Joanie? What are some of the behaviors Andy exhibits that might be apparent to Joanie or that he needs to recognize as
signs that he is not functioning optimally?
Clinical Example: Mitchell and the Therapeutic Gift
Mitchell, aged 48, had been a private
practicing clinical psychologist for 20
years. Single and never married, he
maintained a home office in a somewhat rural area. He had a part-time
secretary who mostly took messages
(continued)
Promoting Self-Awareness
Can you imagine yourself in any of the preceding situations? Depending on the
amount of experience you have had as a therapist, the answer to the question
is sure to vary. Whereas these scenarios each differ, there are common themes
among them. These themes can be tied back to some of the core principles of
cognitive-behavioral theory and practice.
436 What Every Clinician Needs to Know
Clinical Example: Mitchell and the Therapeutic Gift (Continued)
and processed billing for him. Among
his various clients, Mitchell began seeing a 36-year-old mother, Anna, who
had three children (ages 4, 6, and 9)
and whose husband of 11 years had just
announced that he was leaving her for
someone else. Mitchell described this
woman as competent, educated, resilient, and very attractive. She was reportedly a dedicated mother, wife, and
respected colleague in her part-time
position as a project manager for a
pharmaceutical company. Her goal for
therapy was to focus her efforts on constructing her future life around her
children’s well-being, financial security,
and eventual comfort of a new romantic relationship.
Mitchell was intrigued by Anna’s rationality, pragmatism, and goal-oriented
approach to life. He found himself
thinking about her between sessions
when he drove by basketball courts that
reminded him of stories she told about
her children’s love of sports. He appreciatively noticed women who wore
glasses and accessories similar to Anna’s
distinct style. On one occasion, he purchased a three-dollar key ring that had a
clever saying on it that he thought captured what could be Anna’s motto for
life, “Don’t wait for chance—Create happiness around you!” He rationalized to
himself that the key chain would be a
therapeutic reminder for her to maintain
her positive attitude. He found himself
self-disclosing his own coping practices
and mantras that helped him through
specific difficult times in the past, which
he detailed for her.
As time progressed, Mitchell’s availability for sessions with Anna seemed to
push later and later into the evening,
and beyond the hours when his secretary was present. He allowed a 30-
minute break prior to her session that
allowed him to “rejuvenate,” by showering and freshening up. Often, she held
the last session of the evening, and her
time allotment extended beyond the
standard 60 minutes as she talked and
talked about her problems, efforts, solutions, and goals. Anna was grateful for
the support and help. She was focused
exclusively on her own challenging situation of managing three children, an
emotional divorce, increasing work responsibilities, and reestablishing her independence, and therefore, didn’t think
twice about the change in her session
time. She assumed he gave all of his
clients this extra attention.
Points to Ponder: Mitchell had been in
private practice for 20 years and therefore,
had much experience in the practice of therapy with no reported history of inappropriate or unethical behavior. How could
Mitchell have identified his stray from appropriate professional practice? What reactions to Anna did he have that should have
been signs for him to monitor his behavior
more closely? If Mitchell avoided or denied
his emotions or feelings toward Anna, what
behaviors might he have recognized as potentially problematic?
First, therapists need to use their own feelings as cues to potential problematic situations. This is a key concept for self-awareness and professional
problem solving.
Second, the link between thoughts, feelings, beliefs, and actions is clear
both for the individual therapist, the individual client, and the interactions between them. The concept of Bandura’s (1977) reciprocal determinism (the idea
that a person affects his or her environment, which in turn, affects the person’s
thoughts, feelings, and behaviors) is illustrated in these examples. Because of
the power differential of the therapeutic relationship, the therapist is responsible for being the authority and operating in a competent, nonboundary violating, professional manner.
Third, considering the earlier discussion of how personal problems, psychological distress or impairment, or burnout can impact therapists’ judgment, personal and clinical decision making, self-awareness of stressors and their impact
must be attended to at all times, so that global difficulties will be less likely to
cause inappropriate behavior at an individual client level. Fourth, therapists must
be aware of their ethical and legal obligations to their clients, the community, and
the profession. If self-monitoring reveals that there is potential for ethical or illegal
misconduct, therapists or students-in-training must be aware of their avenues for
prevention of such behavior. These include consultation, supervision, self-care,
and appropriate management of thoughts, feelings, and behaviors that will allow
for best-practice behaviors toward clients, or appropriate termination and referral
of clients if this cannot be achieved. Mitchell could have recognized his boundary
slide when he was spending more and more time thinking about his client. He
could have taken steps to address these thoughts by seeking consultation, beginning his own therapy, or self-monitoring his behaviors more consciously.
Overall, a problem-solving approach to self-awareness and clinical decision-making (Felgoise et al., 2002; A. M. Nezu & Nezu, 1989; A. M. Nezu et al.,
1997) is advocated in monitoring thoughts, feelings, and actions related to professional practice and client care. Recognizing feelings as cues (such as Andy’s
feelings for his client), challenging your own thoughts and beliefs, and identifying behaviors that are adaptive or maladaptive in clinical situations and relationships are imperative (e.g., delaying termination or holding longer sessions).
Identifying potential problems, goals, and relevant obstacles to those problems
will be important for prevention and intervention, should it get to that point.
Generating alternative solutions for handling potentially problematic situations, and making rational and systematic decisions about how to handle the
situations based on the generated solutions is critical. Perhaps most importantly, implementing the solutions and monitoring the consequences of your
behaviors, decisions, and solutions will be critical to the overall outcome of
your professional conduct in the specific situations addressed. If the outcomes
are unsatisfactory, or the alternatives are unlikely to reach the goals, troubleshooting and seeking professional help are part of all therapists’ professional
responsibility, as described earlier.
Self-Assessment of Burnout, Distress, and Daily Hassles
Given the popularity of burnout, distress, and daily hassles as topics in the public domain, self-assessments of these constructs are widely available. A simple

Identifying and Confronting Inappropriate or Problematic
Behaviors in Peer-Trainees or Colleagues
If we have established that identifying potentially problematic reactions to
clients is important, yet preventing misconduct or inappropriate behavior can
sometimes be difficult for professionals, how does this compare with doing the
same for our colleagues or peers in the profession? If the preceding examples
presented clearly identifiable targets for change or intervention, then shouldn’t
it be that easy to identify the problems in our colleagues or peers? We would
argue, yes . . . and no. Yes, if information is provided in the same forthright
manner, it should be easy to identify problematic situations for professionals
who are knowledgeable and aware. However, the answer is often no because
information is seldom so easily obtainable from trainees, either because supervisees are fearful of sharing information that could affect their evaluations, or
lack of self-awareness prevents sharing pertinent information that would allow
others to identify problematic situations. Audio- or videotapes for review
would help, but trainees still would need to share the thoughts and feelings that
guided the behaviors in question, and that is not always easy for students to do.
Many professionals practice therapy independently and do not take advantage
of or seek peer supervision, consultation, or client feedback. There would be
few forums for other professionals to gain access to scenarios like the ones previously described unless therapists sought help in these situations. It is possible,
however, that therapists could learn of the problematic behaviors through the
clients themselves, should they seek out other therapy or assistance relating to
such matters.
Now, imagine that Mina, Lola, Andy, and Mitchell have inadvertently
shared the scenarios with you, either through consultation, casual conversation, or their supervision of you! However, they are unaware of the potential
problems that could arise. How would you give them this feedback? What are
some of the reasons that you might not give them this feedback, even if you
thought it is warranted?
438 What Every Clinician Needs to Know
Why might Mina’s, Lola’s, Andy’s, or Mitchell’s supervisors, supervisees,
or other peers or colleagues not confront them, despite the Ethics Code’s (APA,
2002) explicit principle that explains professionals’ responsibility to do so? Try
to recall if you have ever had to give feedback to friends or family members
about something they have said or done that was unacceptable or concerning to
you? What skills were necessary for you to do so?
Confronting problematic behavior is seldom if ever an easy task. Providers
of negative feedback must have acute communication skills, assertiveness
skills, confidence in their own appraisal of situations but reservation about the
limits of their perspective, and feelings of physical, emotional, and interpersonal safety to communicate such information. They must choose an appropriate context for offering feedback and approach the task with an attitude of tact
and respect. Also, the perceived risks cannot outweigh the potential benefit or
responsibility identified by the feedback provider. Supposing an individual had
all the necessary strengths and skills listed, there are still obstacles. Many of
these were reviewed earlier, which brings this chapter’s discussion almost to a
full circle: to the operational definitions of impairment and problematic behavior; few options for remediation or self-help specific to professional issues;
somewhat vague ethical guidelines and principles; and potentially severe consequences for trainees or professionals if behaviors are determined to be significant. The effort or emotional conflict or discomfort felt by the observer of the
inappropriate behavior may be consciously or unconsciously a deterrent for
getting involved in such situations. Principles of social psychology such as bystander apathy and diffusion of responsibility may also come into play. Readers
are encouraged to role-play or rehearse how they would address these issues
with their peers, colleagues, or supervisors, should the situations ever arise.
When Reactions to Clients Lead to Inappropriate or
Unethical Behavior
Unseasoned practitioners or trainees may think that it is unlikely they would
find themselves in situations such as those described, where their judgments
are clouded or their actions are faulty. Seasoned professionals might be able to
identify with some of these experiences, or recall their vulnerability. They realize that no-one is error-proof and belief in the idea of invulnerability increases
the risk of mistakes. In fact, anyone could put themselves at risk for engaging in
inappropriate or unethical behavior, when in unfavorable circumstances. When
self-care is poor, and burnout is high, it is likely that judgment, decision making, and boundaries are compromised. We challenge you to think about how
you behave, think, and feel when you are burned out, or are neglecting selfcare. Are your judgments clear? When you lack sleep, do you find yourself less
inhibited or attentive? Pulling together the concepts of self-care, burnout, and
risks for unethical behavior, we encourage you to think about how clinicians
find themselves in situations like the ones we have described.
Personal therapist characteristics are known to be risk factors for troubled
outcome. Koocher and Keith-Speigel (1998) published a book that we highly
recommend: Ethics in Psychology: Professional Standards and Cases (second edition).
In review of hundreds of case studies, ethics, law, decision making, standards
Self-Care and Ethics 439
and best practices, they illustrate the challenges professional psychologists (practitioners, scholars, educators, etc.) face in daily practice, and discuss ways to
prevent inappropriate, unethical, and illegal conduct.
Koocher and Keith-Speigel (1998) discuss several categories of risk factors
for inappropriate behavior or conduct either as a result of poor judgment, or as
a result of poor self-monitoring or coping with reactions to clients. The likelihood that therapists or students will engage in role blending, crossing professional boundaries, and maintaining conflicts of interest is often increased by
the behaviors and circumstances of “risky therapists,” “risky career periods,”
“risky work settings,” and “risky clients” (pp. 174–176). The research summarized by Koocher and Keith-Speigel is vast, but several highlights are important
to the purpose of this chapter on self-care and prevention of negative consequences from impairment, personal problems, and incompetence.
Risky therapists are described as those who demonstrate poor boundaries
(Koocher & Keith-Speigel, 1998) by actions that cross the expected limits for
professional behavior. Such therapists are prone to excessive, unnecessary, and
often inappropriate self-disclosure. Gift-giving and acceptance of gifts raise serious questions and concerns about clients’ well-being and best interests, and
whose needs (therapists’ or clients’) are being served. Therapists with poor
boundaries, inexperience, and poor judgment are most likely to engage in giftgiving or gift-accepting practices when they are not in the clients’ best interest,
or when the therapist does not even know to evaluate the consequences of such
actions.
Risky therapists may have personal problems themselves that lead them to
seek “adoration, power, or social connection” (Koocher & Keith-Speigel, 1998,
p. 174) through their professional work. Certain theoretical orientations might
also be likely to draw persons with these risky characteristics into training. Or
perhaps, practice within certain theoretical orientations is less well defined,
and therefore allows for boundary violations (Koocher & Keith-Speigel). Further exploration of clinical judgment and boundary management is offered by
Barnett (1998) or Zur (2007).
Risky career periods are explained by Koocher and Keith-Speigel (1998)
as potentially occurring at any time. Misconduct or inappropriate management
of thoughts, feelings, and behaviors toward clients is easily understandable,
though not acceptable, during early training, especially if supervision or rolemodeling was poor, or when students have had minimal experience handling
complicated reactions and issues. The midcareer time frame is considered risky
due to the increased likelihood that psychologists might experience more personal problems across the biopsychosocial domain during that time in their lifespan. Lastly, late-stage career professionals might be considered risky due to
the potential for distance from the standards of the practice, and inflated beliefs
about their own competence and judgment as a result of passage of time.
Risky work settings include those in which professionals are practicing
psychology in isolation from other psychologists or mental health professionals
(Koocher & Keith-Speigel, 1998). Home offices have also been considered a potential risk source or factor because of the automatic information known by the
client about the therapist, and the possibly intimate and personal nature of such
a setting (Koocher & Keith-Speigel). Nontraditional settings or those with multi440 What Every Clinician Needs to Know
disciplinary teams might also create less clear boundaries. Physicians and patients have different expectations of appropriate boundaries than do psychologists and patients or clients. Also, psychologists are more exposed to patients in
vulnerable states, such as various levels of undress, fear, or consciousness due to
medication or procedures conducted. Patients might attribute their survival or
ability to cope with such circumstances entirely to therapists’ participation in
their care, as differentiated from those who were poking and prodding them for
physical care.
Risky clients probably need less description than the other categories described. Clients who have poor boundaries, low self-esteem, neediness, high
dependency, or experiences of abuse, victimization, or abandonment in their
past or current circumstances might present opportunities for risky therapists
or naive therapists to engage in misconduct, knowingly or not. Risky clients
might look to the therapist as a replacement for lost persons in their lives, or for
them to serve in roles they have not been able to fill outside the professional relationship (Koocher & Keith-Speigel, 1998).
Preventing Psychologists’ Problems from Becoming
Professional Problems: Identifying the Warning Signs
Koocher and Keith-Speigel (1998) discuss the fact that therapists can be caring,
compassionate persons who experience a wide range of emotions in personal
situations and in reaction to clients, and still these same individuals are ethical
and professional in maintaining appropriate boundaries with consumers of
their services and expertise. They note that the literature suggests that individuals who engage in inappropriate, unethical, or impaired practice either due to
personal problems, incompetence, or other reasons, often lack insight about
their judgment and actions and rationalize their behaviors as actions intended
to be in the best interest of their clients (p. 197). Table 15.1 provides a list of
warning signs and signals of boundary crossings that may result from extreme
emotional, cognitive, or behavior reactions to clients. It is offered by Koocher
and Keith-Speigel (1998), and encompasses works described by Epstein and
Simon (1990, as cited by Koocher & Keith-Speigel, 1998, p. 198).
Crossing boundaries by engaging in sexual intimacies with clients is a significant problem that often seems so far out of the realm of possibility to students in training because the rationale for why this is not acceptable makes
sense. Estimates of the frequency of such conduct are hard to guess or obtain
due to the low report rate of such occurrences. However, even if estimates are
as low as recent reports suggest (0.9% for male therapists, 0.2% for female
therapists; Borys & Pope, 1989), psychologists are still violating the professional role by engaging in sexual intimacies with clients. Koocher and KeithSpeigel (1998) explain that many instances of sexual attraction will diminish
and do not result in inappropriate conduct. However, for some, these feelings
will escalate into unacceptable behavior. Table 15.2 describes 10 warning signs
of sexual attraction toward clients (Koocher & Keith-Speigel, 1998, p. 203).
The warning signs and signals provided by Koocher and Keith-Speigel
(1998) are helpful in differentiating potentially problematic thoughts, feelings,
and behaviors from those that are typical and expected in therapy. Self-reflection
Self-Care and Ethics 441
and self-awareness are critical aspects of the self-monitoring process as well. As
noted, therapists with personal problems and their own diagnosable mental
illness or difficulties should pay extra attention to their vulnerabilities and behaviors. Balancing one’s life between personal and professional roles and responsibilities and engaging in adaptive coping skills and stress management
should help therapists maintain healthy lifestyles and appropriate boundaries.
Therapists who ensure they have adequate social and emotional resources (professional or not), physical or stress outlets, opportunities for spiritual grounding
or exploration (if interested), and opportunities for meaningful interpersonal
and environmental experiences should have less need to seek comfort or personal affiliation through their clientele. For readers who identify themselves as
lacking in one or more areas mentioned, self-help resources are provided for addressing stress, emotional reactions, and personality characteristics that might
present challenges to working with others. Of course, persons need to identify

sought.
Self-Help References
Appendix A lists self-help materials that authors reviewing such materials recommend highly; we have used some of these works in therapy with our clients.
Norcross et al. (2000), provide thorough annotated bibliographies on over 15
mental health topics in the Authoritative Guide to Self-Help Resources in Mental
Health, developed on the basis of five national survey studies conducted on over
2,500 psychologists who are members of either the Clinical Psychology or
Counseling Psychology divisions of the American Psychological Association.
O’Halloran and Linton (2000) provide annotated references to self-care resources for counselors who experience stress on the job. While their focus is on
burnout and secondary traumatic stress from working with traumatized individuals, we selected references that seem to have broader application to psychologists working with a variety of persons.
The references appended to this chapter are by no means exhaustive,
given that self-help books are published in extremely high volume—estimated
at about 2,000 a year (G. M. Rosen, 1993). Readers are cautioned that self-help
may be independently beneficial when burnout and distress have not led to impaired functioning, or problems are still within grasp of self-management. Otherwise, professional help may be warranted, and these resources may be best
used as supplements. The discussion provided in this chapter and some of the

Positive Psychology
To this point, this chapter has mirrored the historical emphasis in the field of
clinical psychology, with the focus on problems, impairment, dysfunction,
and weaknesses and the alleviation of such. Clinical psychology has traditionally looked at psychological health as the absence of maladies or concerns, and
the goals of intervention have been to reduce negative traits, thoughts, feelings, behaviors, belief systems, and interpersonal and social relationships. Although many therapies also tout goals to increase positive thinking, feeling,
and behaving; adaptive belief systems; and interpersonal relationships, they
are usually secondary goals of the therapeutic process and seldom the reason
clients seek therapy. In fact, the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-IV) does not provide codes for positive change targets, nor do insurance companies pay for clinical psychologists to provide guidance in
increasing adaptive behaviors and competencies. In the past 10 years, however, there has been a major movement toward positive psychology as a science
examining happiness, well-being, human potential, and social strengths.
From the research focused on positive psychology, investigators aim to reconstruct the approach to maximizing individual potential and well-being by
focusing on building strengths and resiliency factors, rather than just minimizing disability and deficits. Clinical psychologists and other researchers
have begun to reexamine concepts such as burnout (Maslach et al., 2001)
from the vantage point of positive psychology research, and are learning more
about job engagement and positive approaches to alleviating negative syndromes such as those addressed earlier. The discussion that follows provides
only a cursory overview of key concepts in this field. Yet, the hope is that
readers will be inspired to learn more about this field and the topic areas as a
means for self-enhancement, self-care, and self-discovery.
Happiness and Subjective Well-Being
Happiness and subjective well-being refer to positive feelings and positive
states. Understanding these states is at the core of positive psychology (Seligman, 2002). There is some debate in the field as to whether happiness should
be defined by “the good life in terms of pleasure seeking and pain avoidance,”
also known as the hedonic tradition, or “the good life in terms of achieving one’s
full potential,” called the eudaimonic tradition (Carr, 2004, p. 41). Seligman
(2002) describes positive emotions as occurring in the past, present, and the future. Past positive emotions relating to happiness include “satisfaction, contentment, fulfillment, pride and serenity” (Carr, 2004, p. 2). Present happiness is
said to include momentary pleasures and more enduring gratifications (Carr,
2004). Future happiness is associated with positive emotions such as optimism,
hope, confidence, faith, and trust (Carr, 2004).
444 What Every Clinician Needs to Know
Pleasures, as described in Seligman’s (2002) view of positive emotions,
are derived through the senses and through positive experiences that result in
positive emotions. Gratifications are dependent on engagement in activities
that result in achieving flow through signature strengths (Carr, 2004). Flow and
signature strengths are key concepts to positive psychology.
Flow
Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi coined the term flow, and defined it as “a particular
kind of experience that is so engrossing and enjoyable that it becomes . . . worth
doing for its own sake even though it may have no consequence outside itself.
Creative activities, music, sports, games, and religious rituals are typical sources
for this kind of experience” (Csikszentmihalyi, 1999, p. 824). However, flow experiences can occur during studying, reading, dancing, writing, driving, or doing
anything that one intensely loves to do. Persons who are experiencing flow are
said to lose their sense of time, be completely engrossed in the activity generating this state, and experience a sense of ecstasy or excitement that can almost
seem too powerful or great . . . as if they are outside of themselves (Csikszentmihalyi, 1999). Flow is said to require skill, concentration, and perseverance,
and is thought to lead to subjective well-being. Csikszentmihalyi (1999) suggests that people are not necessarily experiencing happiness while they are in
flow experiences because they are not thinking about their feelings or emotions
at that time. Rather, the positive feelings such as happiness may be the result of
experiencing flow. Csikszentmihalyi (1999) states that “People are happy not
because of what they do, but because of how they do it” (p. 826).
The take-home message from this discussion of flow and happiness is that
trainees and psychologists need to find what makes them fully engaged and engrossed to the point that they have positive outlets and escapes, so to speak,
from their ordinary stressors and hassles. Activities, whether work-related
(writing or reading), personal, or social, that activate flow experiences and
stimulate cognitive, spiritual, or physical channels may be those that help balance oneself in a meaningful way that could buffer against burnout, psychological distress, and eventual impairment, and increase enjoyment from
participation in everyday work and personal experiences.
Strengths
In addition to engaging in flow, possessing human strengths such as courage,
future-mindedness, optimism, interpersonal skill, faith, work ethic, hope, honesty, perseverance, and self-determination, has been discovered to provide
buffers against mental illness and distress (Seligman & Csikszentmihalyi,
2000). Examining human strengths is thought to help make people stronger
and more productive (Seligman & Csikszentmihalyi, 2000), and also helps
them cope with life better. Examining individuals’ strengths is another key
focus of positive psychology, and is pertinent to the topic of self-care.
Signature strengths, are defined as strengths individuals have that are core
attributes of themselves; whose use are cause for excitement; that promote rapid
learning when used; that are desired to be used often with resulting feelings of
Self-Care and Ethics 445
positive emotions when they are used; and could be used in many situations
(Seligman, 2002). Signature strengths are determined by self-assessment according to the Values in Action Classification System (C. Peterson & Seligman,
2001), which examines 24 possible strengths. Based on a review of Seligman’s
work, Carr (2004) suggests that signature strengths are important in romantic
relationships, familial relationships, work settings, and leisure activities. Use of
signature strengths is thought to be related to the experience of flow. Trainees
and professionals may increase self-care and positive affectivity if they can identify their signature strengths, use them, and initiate experiences that will lead to
self-efficacy, happiness, and satisfaction.
Other Key Concepts in Positive Psychology
Other personal characteristics are frequently considered in examination of positive psychology and the study of human strengths. Such topics include quality
of life, expectations, the roles of emotional intelligence, giftedness, creativity
and wisdom, positive motives and traits, positive self (self-esteem, self-efficacy,
coping), and positive relationships (Carr, 2004). Although discussion of these
detailed topics is beyond the scope of this chapter, much can be learned from
delving into these topics. Yet, to remain focused on self-care, happiness, flow,
and signature strengths were chosen as focal points for discussion.
Happiness: Who Experiences It and How Can You Acquire
More of It?
A review of the empirical and theoretical literature suggests that positive affectivity, which results from positive experiences, pleasures, and gratifications, is “associated with greater job satisfaction and marital satisfaction and
may be enhanced through regular physical activity, adequate sleep, regular
socializing with close friends and striving for valued goals” (Carr, 2004,
pp. 39–40). These conclusions suggest that trainees and professionals seeking
a fuller and more positive personal and work life might benefit greatly from
learning about positive psychology research outcomes and predictors of happiness for the population-at-large, and professionals, specifically. Furthermore, studies reveal that persons reporting high degrees of happiness are
generally extraverted and optimistic, and have high self-esteem and internal
locus of control. Carr (2004) summarizes the recommendations and conclusions drawn from empirical studies (Argyle, 2001; Buss, 2000; Diener, Suh,
Lucas, & Smith, 1999; Lykken, 1999; Myers, 1992; Seligman, 2002) on happiness and positive emotions to suggest the following:
We can optimize our sense of well-being by taking some of the following courses of
action. With respect to relationships, mate with someone similar, communicate
kindly and clearly and forgive faults; maintain contact with extended family;
maintain a few close friendships; co-operate with acquaintances; and engage in religious or spiritual practices. With respect to the environment, secure physical and
financial safety and comfort for yourself and your family,... live in a geographically beautiful environment where there is fine weather and where there is pleas446 What Every Clinician Needs to Know
ing music and art. With respect to physical well-being, maintain good health and
engage in regular physical exercise. With respect to productivity, use skills that are
intrinsically pleasing for tasks that are challenging; achieve success and approval
at work that is interesting and challenging; and work toward a coherent set of
goals. With respect to leisure, eat quality food in moderation; regularly rest, relax
and take holidays in moderation; and engage in co-operative recreational activities
with groups of friends. (pp. 40–41)
Although Carr’s (2004) summary of the research findings and suggestions
seems general and unencumbered by barriers, the recommendations make sense.
Too often, we may overcomplicate our understanding of human behavior and the
approaches we take to optimizing our lives. As such, Carr’s synopsis is deemed
relevant and valuable to the discussion of self-care. We recommend that trainees
and professionals seek out the literature Carr draws on to explore areas that seem
most pertinent or that could be used for introspective focus. Carr also reviews
suggestions and advice to decrease negative affectivity, negative feelings, and dysfunctional thoughts, schemas, and beliefs. However, since much of clinical psychology focuses on these goals and approaches, they are not reiterated here.
A small survey of program and clinical training directors on the National
Council of Schools and Programs of Professional Psychology listserve, conducted for this chapter on self-care, showed that many psychologists in leadership roles in Clinical PsyD programs are practicing what Carr suggests. Box
15.1 summarizes the responses. This is great news because if graduate training
and program directors model good self-care behavior, the hope is that students
will practice good self-care behavior as well.

Self-Assessment of Happiness, Strengths, Well-Being, Quality
of Life and Emotions
Numerous scales are available to measure happiness, strengths, and psychological and subjective well-being, quality of life, and emotions. Carr (2004) provides useful reference lists of measures available for research and self-testing
on all these variables. Among those that measure happiness are the following:
“The Satisfaction with Life Scale” (Diener, Emmons, Larsen, & Griffin, 1985),
“The Extended Satisfaction with Life Scale,” (Alfonso, Allinson, Rader, & Gorman, 1996), and “The Depression-Happiness Scale” (Joseph & Lewis, 1998).
The “Values in Action Inventory of Strengths” is a popular measure used to
evaluate signature strengths as defined by Seligman and his colleagues (C. Peterson & Seligman, 2001), which also can be accessed through a public website
(www.positivepsychology.org/viastrengthsinventory.htm).
Self-Help and Self-Exploration References on
Positive Psychology
Appendix B provides additional resources to aid trainees and professionals in
maximizing their positive well-being and minimizing possible precursors to distress, burnout, and impairment. The reference lists provided focus on positive
psychology topics and are gleaned from the same resources as the previous lists.
Summary
Throughout this chapter, numerous suggestions have been made to increase
psychologists’-in-training and professionals’ awareness of burnout, impairment, personal reactions to clients, and professional and ethical issues relating
to these topics. Trainees and professionals need to be mindful of setting clear
boundaries with clients and other professionals. Maintaining career vitality and
good self-care practices ought to also help minimize the likelihood of burning
out. Social support and good mentorship and supervision serve as buffers to
prevent personal problems from developing into professional problems and
risky behaviors. Suggestions have been made as to how trainees and professionals can be more self-aware and self-reflective of thoughts, feelings, and behaviors that might be cause for concern when responsible for others’ well-being, or
for their own well-being.
Cognitive and behavioral strategies that have been discussed throughout
this book are revisited in discussion of self-care. Self-monitoring through journaling, self-talk, and reflection of how one’s behaviors impact others in personal and professional domains is advisable. Seeking peer consultation or
professional supervision is critical to ongoing growth and development of professional skills, and prevention of boundary violations, ethical infractions, or
misconduct. Supervision or consultation can and should be instrumental in reviewing thoughts, feelings, behaviors, and biases that could be working in favor
of or against the care of clients. Use of video- or audiotapes, role-plays, on-site


observation, and review of case materials can augment actual caseload discussion, and should be used when possible. Learning clinical decision making, and
problem-solving skills as applied to personal and professional competence is
strongly advised.
There are ways to gain mentoring and supervision outside one’s own training program. Students and professionals can benefit greatly from observing professionals in practice and listening to clinical and ethical decision making by
seasoned and responsible professionals they encounter in the field, at workshops
or presentations or through readings. Maintaining affiliation with peer and advanced trainees and professionals through listserves and professional organizations offers means to discuss, problem-solve, and explore issues that are less
likely to be found in textbooks or didactic exercises. Topics addressed in these forums might include how one manages personal stress and life demands, emotional reactions to clients, and grey areas of professional practice.
Trainees’ and professionals’ use of personal psychotherapy for growth, development, or intervention was also discussed in this chapter. For those who do
not undertake therapy, but want to address personal matters less formally, a
sampling of self-help assessments and intervention resources has been provided. This abbreviated list offers direction for those who have recognized the
need for pursuit of self-care in response to reading this chapter, or as a handy
guide for future reference. Many of the strategies and techniques discussed
throughout this chapter have also been applied and defined in reference to caring for colleagues, addressing colleagues with perceived personal or professional difficulties, and attending to impairment and incompetence in the field,
both in training and in the public professional domain. Lastly, the movement of
positive psychology was introduced and key concepts highlighted to encourage
developing professionals to initiate flow experiences, enhance their signature
strengths, and maximize the positive aspects of their personal styles.
Trainees and professionals need to maintain a sense of balance in their
lives that allows for healthy self-care and attention, and development of meaningful relationships and personal experiences that enhance positive feelings,
develop a strong sense of personal and professional self, and keep themselves in
tune to how external situations are impacting their behaviors, thoughts, and
feelings, and vice versa:
